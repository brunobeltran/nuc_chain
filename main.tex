% Most notably, in a nucleosome, DNA winds around the histone octamer to form an

We present an analytical model for the effects of these rigid kinks on the
    physical organization of chromosomal DNA\@.
For periodic kinks, the elasticity of chromatin chains is extremely sensitive to
    nucleosome repeat length.
In contrast, we show that heterogeneity in nucleosome spacing eliminates this
    sensitivity, allowing us to robustly predict the Kuhn length of chromatin in
    various cell types.
In addition, we find that by merely rearranging the positions of intervening
    nucleosomes, it is possible to change the probability that two genomic
    loci loop together by up to 6 orders of magnitude.
Our results are broadly applicable to any semiflexible polymer with aperiodic
    defects, and the their implications for the flexibility and cyclizability of

% \section{\label{sec:intro}Introduction}
%TODO bad hbox when attempting line break of the following sentence
In the cell, DNA and its associated proteins---collectively, chromatin---are
    carefully organized both spatially and temporally.
This organization is known to play a role in a myriad of biological processes,
    from controlling gene expression~\cite{hubner2013} to facilitating DNA
    damage repair~\cite{hauer2017,stadler2017}, and has motivated a large body
    of work on the statistical mechanics of the chromatin fiber.

The fundamental repeating unit of Eukaryotic chromatin organization is the
    nucleosome, which is formed by 147 basepairs of DNA wrapped around a histone
    octamer~\cite{cutter2015a}.
Linker DNA connecting adjacent nucleosomes ranges from $<$\SI{10}{\basepair} on
    average in fission yeast~\cite{givens2012} to {$\approx$\SI{50}{\basepair}} in human
    cells~\cite{schones2008}.
Nucleosomes, along with their intervening linkers, collectively form the
    beads on a string model of the chromatin fiber.

% It has been well established that changing nucleosome positioning can lead to
%     drastically different chromatin structures.
% %However, no analytical theory exists to describe
% Chromatin chains with different nucleosome positions will have drastically
%     different structures.
It has been well established \textit{in silico} that individual chromatin chains
    with different linker lengths will have drastically different structures.
%TODO make this sound better
However, the field lacks an analytical theory to describe the relationship
    between linker lengths and the fiber's structure.
However,
While simulations have historically highlighted huge discrepancies in chromatin
    organization as a function of linker lengths~\cite{bascom2017a,
    collepardo-guevara2014, bascom2018, grigoryev2016, kepper2008, koslover2010,
    langowski2007, muller2014, schiessel2001, scipioni2010, wedemann2002,
    woodcock1993%
    %these are "meh" norouzi2015, stolz2010,
    }, the field still lacks a systematic understanding of the effects of
    linker length on chromatin's structure.
As a result, most models simply treat chromatin as an effective wormlike chain
    (WLC), where the persistence length $l_p$ is chosen to either arbitrarily
    match that of bare DNA~\cite{benedetti2017, macpherson2018, nuebler2018} or
    to fit the quantity being measured~\cite{sanborn2015,pierro2017}.

Our lab previously published the analytical solution to the beads on a string
    model with WLC linkers for the special case of constant linker
    lengths~\cite{koslover2013a}.
However, nucleosomes in the cell are almost never perfectly spaced.
The occupancy profiles of even the most well-positioned nucleosomes---such as
    those near transcription start sites---are well described by a model where
    nucleosomes instead bind uniformly along the DNA~\cite{kornberg1988,%

    are merely excluded from certain areas~\cite{ozonov2013}.
% These models are referred to as the ``lattice gas'' picture of nucleosome
%     binding, after the Tonks gas they generalize.


%BRUNO: consider including the following if there's space
%The main disagreement between these lattice-gas models and experimental data
    % was due to the experimental data being more ``smooth'' than the
    % model~\cite{beshnova2014}.
%This inspired many additions to the model, most
    % notably, introduction of non-nucleosome non-specific DNA binding
    % proteins and partial nucleosome unwrapping~\cite{beshnova2014}.
% However, recent single-cell MNAse-seq data~\cite{lai2018} do not show this
    % discrepancy\footnote{Compare the red and green curves in Figure 2a and 2c
    % of \citep{lai2018} to see how pooling multiple cells can cause the effects
    % that \citep{beshnova2014} attempt to prevent by adding unwrapping to their
    % model.}, suggesting that the most naive lattice gas
    % model with uniform binding and no unwrapping can likely explain nucleosome
    % positioning in human cells.

In this paper, we extend our analytical theory to incorporate arbitrarily spaced
    kinks, and use it to investigate the effects of realistic nucleosome spacing
    on chromatin structure.

We first revisit the special case of fixed linker lengths to build intuition for
    the effects of kinks in a WLC.\@
We use this intuition to show how, for heterogenous linker lengths,
    chromatin's structure exhibits ``universality''.
Namely, the structure is independent of the particular distribution of the
    linker lengths.
This result allows us to calculate looping probabilities and the Kuhn length
    of chromatin as a function of the average linker length without specifying a
    detailed model of nucleosome binding.

% Our simple model fills an important gap by providing physical intuition for how
%     nucleosome positioning guides chromatin organization.

\section{\label{sec:model}Model}
First, we make rigorous our ``beads on a string'' model of chromatin.
We treat each linker DNA as a WLC and nucleosomes as the points where these
    WLC's are connected.
At each nucleosome, we impose the constraint that the incoming and outgoing
    linker DNA strands have a fixed relative orientation. This relative
    orientation $\Omega_\text{kink}  = {(\Omega^{(i)}_\text{entry})}^{-1}
    \Omega^{(i)}_\text{exit}$ between the $i$th and $(i+1)$th linkers is
    determined by the nucleosome structure, as shown in
    Figure~\ref{fig:nuc-geo}.

We represent this sequence of WLC's as a space curve $\vec{R}(s)$, $s\in[0,L]$, along
    with a triad of vectors describing the chain's orientation at each location
    $\vec{t_i}$, where $\vec{t_3} \coloneqq \partial_s \vec{R}(s)$.
% thoughts on deleting this? yeah I'm good with deleting this
% Here, $s$ tracks only along the linker DNA, since each nucleosome is merely
    % considered a point on the curve.
We track the bend and twist of our polymer via the Euler vector $\omega_i$
    defined by ${\Omega(s) = \partial_s \vec{t_i}(s) = \omega_i(s) \times
    \vec{t_i}(s)}$.

We begin by computing the Green's function of the first linker, which represents
the probability that the polymer of length $L_1$, which begins at
the origin with fixed initial orientation $\Omega_0$, will end at position
$\vec{R}$ with fixed end orientation $\Omega$.
For a twistable WLC with no kinks, the Green's function is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:path}
    \gwlc[\Omega_0;L_1]{\vec{R}, \Omega} =\! \int_{0}^{L_1} \!\! \pathd{\Omega(s)}
              \delta(\vec{R} - \!\int_{0}^{L_1} \!\!\vec{t_3} ds)
              e^{-\beta \mathcal{E}},
    % overflows
    % \greens{\vec{R}, \Omega} = \int_{\Omega(s=0)}^{\Omega(s=L)} \pathd{\Omega(s)}
    %           \exp{[-\beta \mathcal{E}]}
    %           \delta\left(\vec{R} - \int_{s=0}^L \vec{t_3} ds\right)
\end{equation}
    where the energy
\begin{equation}\label{eq:energy}
    \beta\energy = \frac{l_p}{2}\int_{0}^{L_1} ds
    (\omega_1^2 + \omega_2 ^2) + \frac{l_t}{2}\int_{0}^{L_1} ds
    {\left(\omega_3 - \tau\right)}^2
\end{equation}
%TODO get citations for DNA structure things
    is quadratic in bend and in twist. {$\tau \approx \SI{10.5}{\basepair}$}
    per turn is the equilibrium twist density of the DNA double helix, and {$l_p
    \approx \SI{50}{\nano\metre}$}, {$l_t \approx \SI{100}{\nano\metre}$} are
    the bend and twist persistence lengths of DNA, respectively.

This equation can be solved analytically in Fourier space
    ($\vec{R} \rightarrow \vec{k}$) by expanding in Wigner
    D-functions~\cite{spakowitz2006}, analogs of spherical harnomics for
    $SO(3)$.
%TODO equation overflows if a period is added
\begin{equation}\label{eq:expansion}
    \ghat{\vec{k}, \Omega} = \sum_{l m j}\sum_{l_0 m_0 j_0} \!\! g_{l_0 m_0 j_0}^{lmj}
        \wigD_l^{mj}(\Omega)\wigD_{l_0}^{m_0 j_0 *}(\Omega_0)
\end{equation}
In order to account for the kink introduced by the nucleosome, we rotate
    the final orientation of the linker DNA ${\Omega = \Omega_\text{entry}}$ to
    $\Omega_\text{exit}$ by replacing
%DEEPTI: why the paranthetical 1? seems unnecessary

The coefficients $B_{l_0 m_0 j_0}^{lmj}(\Omega_\text{kink}^{-1}, L)$ were first
    computed in~\cite{zhou2003}, and an alternative derivation can be found in
    the supplement.

    measurements of the nucleosome have established that histone-bound DNA is
    well approximated by a deformed B-DNA structure, wrapping the histone
    octamer 1.7 times in a superhelix with radius \SI{4.19}{\nano\metre} and a
    pitch of \SI{2.59}{\nano\metre}~\cite{richmond2003}.
This means that $\Omega_\text{entry}$ and $\Omega_\text{exit}$ are well defined as a
    function of how many nucleotides are bound to to the histone core.
%even though/While this process is important for allowing DNA-binding proteins to find
%DNA~\cite{polach1995,anderson2000,li2004}, transcript~\cite{kulaeva2007} and replication

%even though it has been directly measured through cryoem in solution that
    % nucleosomes are on average less wrapped than this~\cite{
In what follows, we fix the wrapping level to that found in the crystal
    structure (\SI{146}{\basepair}).
Using different values for the wrapping level does not substantially change our
qualitative
%TODO add different unwrapping example to supplement
    results (see Supplemental Figure XX).
To compose monomers of the nucleosome chain with perscribed linker lengths, we
    perform an iterated convolution of the Green's function in
    equation~\ref{eq:expansion}.
The position and orientation of the $n$th nucleosome exit site is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:conv}
    \greens{\vec{R},\Omega} = \greens[L_n]{\cdot} * \cdots{} * \greens[L_1]{\cdot},
\end{equation}
    where $L = \sum L_i$.
In Fourier space, this corresponds to multiplying the matrices $B(L_i)$
    from Eq.~\ref{eq:expansion}.

Moments of the chain can be computed by noticing that
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:moments}
    $\lim_{k\to0} \frac{\partial^n B_{00}^{00}}{\partial k} = i^n \left\langle
    R^n\right\rangle$.
% \end{equation}
In particular, we extract the elasticity of the chromatin chain via its Kuhn
    length, $b = \lim_{N\to\infty} \RR/\sum_{i=0}^N L_i$.
%DEEPTI:still think we should include equation for the inversion, since it's not
    %purely numerical. Like we did the orientation integrals analytically using the plane
    %wave expansion of spherical harmonics befor computing the numerical k
    %integral.
%BRUNO: which one?
To calculate the propensity for two loci to loop, we numerically invert
    the Fourier transform to evaluate $\greens[L]{\vec{R}}$ at $\vec{R} = 0$,
    where the real-space Green's function is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:realgreens}
    \greens[L]{\vec{R}} = \frac{1}{2\pi^2}\int_0^\infty dk~k^2 j_0(kR) B_{00}^{00}(k;L)
\end{equation}
We note that $P_\text{loop}=\greens[L]{\vec{R}=0}$ corresponds to a modified $J$-factor with no orientational component.

A key property of our model is that the relative orientation of adjacent
    nucleosomes is not just determined by $\Omega_\text{kink}$ and the thermal
    fluctuations of the linker strand.
As demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:linker-effect}, changing the length of the
    linker strand will change the relative orientation of two adjacent
    nucleosomes, even at zero temperature.
%This effect is thanks to the intrinsic twist density of the DNA
%    ($\tau$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:energy}).
Our propagator $G$ takes this property into account implicitly thanks to the
    inclusion of $\tau$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:energy}.

\section{\label{sec:results}Results}
% what is a kuhn length
Recall that the Kuhn length, $b$, is a universal measure of the long-length
scale behavior of any polymer.
%why do we care about the kuhn length?
More specifically, for any polymer model the end to end distance $\RR$ will
always take the form $\RR = bL$ for large enough $L$.
For the wormlike chain, this length is directly related to the elasticity of
the chain through it's persistence length $b = 2l_p$.

%here's where the chain becomes described only by the kuhn length
In FIG, we see that $\RR$ approaches the Gaussian chain regime after just a
DISTANCE.
This will also hold true for heterogenous chains (FIGS).

%make this paragraph into a paranthetical statemetn that WLC doesn't match short
%\RR
The first question we seek to answer is, how well can we capture the average
end-to-end behavior of the chain by treating chromatin as an effective WLC?

%here's what determines the kuhn length: zero temperature picture
The Kuhn length of the kinked chain has a simple explanation, shown in FIG.
For various linker lengths, we plot the Kuhn length of the chain along with
the minimum energy state of the chain.
In practice, the chain fluctuates thermally around this minimum energy
configuration by an amount determined by $l_p$, and it is this fluctuating
chain that the Kuhn length is measuring.
However, as can be seen in FIG, the Kuhn length is well explained by how
processive the chain is at zero temperature.

%% what determines zero temperature pictures for homogenous chain
More precisely, notice that every homogenous chain at zero temperature forms a
helix of nucleosomes (as a consequence of Chasles' theorem).
The rise per basepair of the helix is determined by the spherical angles
$\theta$ and $\phi$ connecting adjacent linkers.
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:entry-exit}, $\theta$ depends solely on the
structure of the nucleosome and the number of base pairs bound to the
nucleosome.
On the other hand, Figure~\ref{fig:linker-effect} show how $\phi$ depends
linearly on the linker length because of the intrinsic helicity of DNA, and the
fact that the nucleosome must be positioned to bind the major groove of the DNA
double helix.

Because $\phi$ depends on the DNA's helicity, the rise/bp of the helix formed by
the nucleosomes of our homogenous chain is \SI{10.5}{\basepair} periodic,
matching the DNA's helical periodicity.
Therefore, for two different linker lengths, we can predict which will have a
larger Kuhn length by using $\phi$ to compute the rise per basepair of its zero
temperature configuration.

%% ? transition to heterogenous chains (maybe b.c. Kuhn is so sensitive to NRL,
%% we suspect there will be large effect for introducing small heterogeneity
While the full theory is required to compute absolute values for the Kuhn length
(see Supp Fig), %as is the long linker limit of kuhn length goes in supp
the geometric intuition for the behavior of the fluctuating
chains is conserved when we move to heterogenous nucleosome spacing.

%% what determines zero temperature picture for het chains
We apply our fluctuating theory to study the chains first considered
in~\cite{woodcock1993}, where the linker lengths are drawn uniformly from a
range $\mu \pm \sigma$.
In FIG, we see that as we increase $\sigma$, the zero-temperature configuration
of the chain interpolates between a helix at $\sigma = 0$ to a an increasingly
random walk at larger $\sigma$.
This is because as we increase $\sigma$, the distribution of $\phi$ connecting
adjacent linkers also becomes broader.
Since $\phi \in [0, 2\pi]$, the distribution of $\phi$ quickly becomes
approximately uniform as $\sigma$ increases.
This is evident in FIG, where we show how Kuhn length of the chains changes as
$\sigma$ increases.

%% how do zero temp and fluct pictures compare?
As in the homogenous case, the processivity of this random walk qualitatively
explains the Kuhn length of the chain overall. Since random linker lengths leads
to random $\phi$, even at zero temperature, the chain is equivalent to a
generalized ``hindered rotating chain'', and so it has a Kuhn length. This
allows us to quantify our geometric notion of ``processivity'', and we show in
FIG how it qualitatively predicts the Kuhn length of the heterogenous chains.
This stands in contrast to models based on combining the thermal fluctuations of
their individual homogenous chains to compute the heterogenous chain's Kuhn
length, which fail dramatically (Supp FIG). We conclude that for realistic
linker lengths, the geometric effects imposed by stochastic nucleosome spacing
dominate the thermal fluctuations of the polymer when determining the structure
of the chromatin chain.

% unversality
If we consider the homogenous case to be simply the minimum entropy arrangement
of nucleosomes for a given mean linker length, then we can predict the Kuhn
% exponential distribution justification from Bayesianness/universality
length that the chains converge to by considering the maximum entropy
distribution for a given average linker length.
% exponential distibution justification from data
This is exactly the distribution
implied by state-of-the-art models of nucleosome positioning~\cite{beshnova2014}.
% approach to universality
For many average linker lengths, the Kuhn length converges to this value with as
little as $\sigma = \SI{1}{\basepair}$ of variability (Supp FIG).

% this makes our model robust to NRL
Thus, by isolating the dependence of chromatin's structure on the distribution of
$\phi$, we are able to conclude that the structure of the homogenous chromatin
chain is unbiological, due to it being unstable to perturbations in the
nucleosome arrangement.


% trans
Since the geometric effects of nucleosomes dominate the structure of the
chromatin chain, we wondered how much rearranging the nucleosomes between two
loci could affect the ability of function chromatin loops to form.
Since our theory allows an analytical solution, we can probe this question
systematically for the first time.
In FIG, we compute the propensity of individual chromatin chains drawn from the maximum
entropy distribution to form loops as a function of the loop size.

We immediately see that the typical model of chromatin as bare DNA
systematically underestimates the looping propensity.
Strikingly, we observe that the difference between the most and least-likely to
loop loci spans six orders of magnitude.
As suggested by our previous results, this huge inter-chain variability is
driven primarily by the different geometrical properties of individual chromatin
chains (Supp FIG showing compact and straight homo chains looping).

We notice that the effects of this heterogeneity are greatest at short length
scales. In fact, as can be seen in FIG, for length scales longer than DISTANCE,
the Gaussian chain probabilities predicted by the Kuhn length of the polymer are
sufficient to quantitatively predict the looping probabilities.

%make sure to mention that you can't fit short length scales (can you?) with an
%effective WLC.
On the other hand, we see that the WLC whose Kuhn length matches the kinked
chain does not have similar short-length scale behavior, even on average.
This suggests that while an effective WLC might be sufficient to capture short
length scale behavior approximately, and a Rouse chain will be sufficient to
treat the chain at intermediate to long length scales, %% make this units bp
the full theory is required for multi-scale models that care about both long
and short range chromatin contacts.

\section{New Discussion}

The dependence of chromatin's structure on the length of its linkers has been
widely discussed since at least the 70's~\cite{finch1976}.
%ugh, phrase this better
However, likely because of a lack of a unifying analytical theory, models
including heterogenously spaced nucleosomes have been comparably
rare~\cite{woodcock1993,collepardo-guevara2014}.


\subsection{\label{sec:homo-chain}Homogenous Chains}

We first revisit the illustrative case of a homogenous chromatin chain, where
    there is a constant linker length separating adjacent nucleosomes.
In the simplifying limit of zero temperature, the linkers are rigid rods, and
    our model is purely geometrical.
The geometrical model with constant linker lengths traces out a helix whose
    pitch is determined solely by the spherical angles $\theta$ and $\phi$
    connecting adjacent linkers.
The angle $\theta$ is fixed by the structure of the nucleosome
    (Figure~\ref{fig:entry-exit}), but the angle $\phi$ between linkers depends
    on the linker length (Figure~\ref{fig:linker-effect}).

In Figure~\ref{fig:homo-kuhn-zoom}, the Kuhn length of the
    fluctuating homogenous chain is compared to the geometric model for
    typical linker lengths.
Since these linkers are much shorter than the \SI{150}{\basepair} persistence
    length of bare DNA, the linkers are approximately rigid rods, and the Kuhn
    length corresponds directly to the shape of the geometric model.

In the short-length limit, the Kuhn length is approximately \SI{10.5}{\basepair}
    periodic.
This reflects the \SI{10.5}{\basepair} helical periodicity of dsDNA.\@
In the limit as the linker length increases, the Kuhn length approaches that of
    bare DNA.\@
However, since the kink density is proportional to the inverse of the linker
    length, this happens slowly (like $1/L_i$), and for realistic linker
    lengths, only $\phi$ matters (Figure~\ref{fig:homo-kuhn-zoom}).

%TODO NEW FIGURE 1a. It will simply show one $\RR$ curve and the best fit WLC
    %near the start of the curve and the best fit gaussian chain nithe long
    %chain limit.
For a regular wormlike chain, the Kuhn length $b = 2 l_p$.
However, Chasles' theorem makes homogenous chains of nucleosomes ``helical''
    wormlike chains~\cite{yamakawa2016}.

However, for the helical wormlike chain,
    amount of DNA contained per unit of rise along the nucleosomal helix,
    as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:homo-kuhn-zoom}.
%TODO: add the example structures back in

Perhaps most notably, the variability between the stiffest and most flexible
    chromatin chains spans over an order of magnitude in Kuhn lengths.
%TODO: color the inaccessible ones
While some of the most compact configurations will sterically inaccesible, this
    demonstrates the drastic effect that nucleosome binding can have on DNA's
    elasticity.

At short length scales, the $\RR$ behaves like a wormlike chain with reduced
    persistence length, due to the linkers being forced to traverse a helix.
At long length scales, the chain predictably asymptotes to a Gaussian
    chain, again with reduced Kuhn length compared to the underlying linkers.
It is noteworthy that the best fit persistence length at short scales and the
    best fit Kuhn length at long scales are quite different (Supplemental Figure
    XX).
Thus, our full theory is required even for calculations involving this
    simplified, homogenous chromatin chain.


\subsection{\label{sec:hetero-kuhn}Heterogenous Nucleosome
\texorpdfstring{$\RR$}{<R2>}}

We now consider the more relevant scenario, when the nucleosomes are randomly
    spaced along the DNA backbone.
%TODO say what we do first, then why we do it
While certain DNA sequences have higher affinities for
    nucleosomes~\cite{something widom}, in practice the most striking features
    of nucleosome positioning data are nucleosome phasing near promoters, CTCF
    sites, and other sites that sterically inhibit nucleosome
    binding~\cite{widom1992}.
These features are predicted to occur by the simplest model of nucleosome
    positioning, one where nucleosomes are positioned uniformly along the DNA
    backbone, and simply sterically excluded from certain sites.
In terms of linker lengths, this model corresponds approximately to the case
    where linker lengths are independent and exponentially distributed about
    their mean.
Thus, while the exact statistics of \textit{in vivo} linker lengths remain to be
    determined, we use the case of independent, exponentially distributed
    linkers as a reference point to show the effect of linker heterogeneity on
    the statistical mechanics of the chromatin fiber.

In analogy to the case of homogenous chains, we find that the zero temperature
    structure provides good intuition for the behavior of the chromatin chain
    when thermal fluctuations are added.
At zero temperature, a chain with random linker lengths is going to have a
    structure determined purely by the interactions between the nucleosome geometry
    and the DNA's intrinsic twist.
In our model, the angle $\theta$ in Figure~\ref{fig:entry-exit} is fixed by the
    nucleosome geometry, but the angle $\phi$ in Figure~\ref{fig:linker-effect}
    is determined by linker length.
As the heterogeneity in linker length increases, this means that the
    zero temperature heterogenous chain will interpolate between a rigid helix
    (in the case of zero linker length variability) and a modified freely
    rotating chain (in the case when linker variability is high enough to make
    the distribution of $\phi$ approximately uniform over $[0, 2\pi]$).

%TODO reincorporate somewhere around here

   %nucleosome positioning data?
%BRUNO:I assume you mean Bascom 2017? yeah but I mean they still use random linker

Simulations of particular chromatin chains with random linker lengths have
    suggested that heterogeneity in nucleosome spacing leads to largely
    disordered chromatin architecture~\cite{woodcock1993,
    collepardo-guevara2014, bascom2017a} reminiscent of modern electron
    microscopy images~\cite{ou2017}.

     length'' (i.e.\ diffusivity) drastically lower than that of bare DNA

    flexibility.}\label{fig:box-kuhns}

    \caption{We compare the kuhn lengths of realistic chromatin fibers

    [Voong] (B), and human T cells  [Valouev] (C)  are marked.}\label{fig:exp-kuhns}
\end{figure}

As expected, for short linker lengths, $<\SI{20}{\basepair}$, the
    zero-temperature, ``geometric'' model predicts the Kuhn length of the chain
    extremely well (Figure~\ref{fig:exp-kuhns}).
As the average linker length
    increases, the geometric picture becomes increasingly processive since each
    linker is still a rigid rod.
On the other hand, the fluctuating chain's Kuhn length stays markedly below the
    \SI{100}{\nano\metre} Kuhn length of the underlying DNA backbone.
While the Kuhn length approaches \SI{100}{\nano\metre} as the linker length
    increases to infinity, this approach is power-law slow (difference shrinks
    as inverse of the linker lengths, see Supplemental Figure XX).
In fact, for realistic linker lengths, the effect is at least a factor of 2.

While exponentially-distributed linker lengths seem like the most natural
    baseline to take, it is equally natural to ask how much variability in the
    nucleosome spacing is needed to create this effect.
While the answer varies depending on the mean linker length to some degree (see
    Supplemental Figure XX for more examples), we show in
    Figure~\ref{fig:box-kuhns} that as little as one base pair of variability
%TODO this statement is almost certainly too strong
    can lead to the chromatin fiber's structure being governed by the
    nucleosome's geometrical properties.

\subsection{\label{sec:looping}Effects of Nucleosome Spacing on Chromatin
Looping}

Chromatin looping is central to biological processes from transcriptional
    control (e.g.\ via promoter-enhancer search) to DNA damage repair (e.g.\ via
    homologous recombination).
In Figure~\ref{fig:looping}, we evaluate our Green's function at $\vec{R} = 0$
    for an ensemble of chains with linker lengths drawn from an exponential
    distribution with mean \SI{54}{\basepair} (using a uniform distribution
    yields similar results, see Supplemental Figure XX).
This quantity quantifies the propensity for two loci on the same chromosome to
    come into contact with each other as a function of their genomic separation.
As expected, the large length scale behavior matches the Gaussian chain scaling
    of $L^{-3/2}$, with the Kuhn length predicted by our earlier analysis.

In comparison to bare DNA, we find that the looping propensity increases
    drastically along the entire chain, as expected due to intra-superhelical
    contacts induced by the nucleosomes' geometry, as well as due to the
    increased elasticity predicted by the model.
More striking than the increase in the looping propensity is the nearly four
    orders of magnitude over which specific rearrangement of nucleosomes can
    modulate the ability of two loci to loop together.
Even at long length scales, where the chain is approximately Gaussian, it is
    possible to increase or decrease the rate of looping by over an order of
    magnitude.
This has profound implications for the ability of chromatin remodelers to act in
    way that can bring together or keep apart related chromosomal loci based on
    the epigenetic environment.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{./figures/fig5_looping_hetero31to52bp.pdf}
    %\includegraphics[width=0.35\linewidth]{./figures/fig-5b-looping-features.png}
    \caption{Each purple line designates an individual chain configuration
    with uniformly random linker lengths between 31 and \SI{51}{\basepair}, with
    the black line representing the average over individual chains. Thus, modulating nucleosome positions can allow the cell to change
    the probability of inter-nucleosomal contacts by up to 6 orders of
    magnitude. The peak in the average curve occurs at around a kilobase, the
    length scale of enhancer-promoter contacts. Although the average,
    heterogenous chain tends towards a Gaussian chain with a shorter
    effective Kuhn length, individual configurations retain memory of rigid kinks
    at intermediate length scales, as indicated by residual peaks in the looping
    probability.}\label{fig:looping}
\end{figure}

Like the Kuhn length, our looping function is largely determined by the
    geometrical properties of the underlying zero-temperature chain.
In Figure~\ref{fig:looping}, two examples of homogenous chains with extremely
    compact or extremely linear geometries are provided to show this.
This suggests that \textit{in vivo}, looping propensity might be largely
    determined by geometrical considerations, at least much more than it is
    determined by the thermal fluctuations in the chromatin fiber.

We notice that the size scale at which this is most true, around
    \SI{1}{\kilo\basepair}, is concommitant with the sizes of loops that must
    %TODO honestly i'm out of brain juice to word this carefully
    often form to construct the transcription initiation complex.
This suggests that the aforementioned phasing of nucleosomes near promoters
    might play a causal role in transcription initiation or repression, and not
    just be a side effect of steric exclusion.

Finally, we note that even though the polymer rapidly approaches the Gaussian
    scaling of $L^\alpha$ where $\alpha \approx -3/2$, the chain is slightly
    non-Gaussian (i.e.\ $\alpha \gtrapprox -3/2$) for size scales even
    approaching that of a full chromosome.
This means that even large-scale, coarse-grained models of chromatin are likely
    to fall short if they rely on Rouse (or WLC) looping probabilities.
This is especially relevant to modeling epigenetic spreading, which requires
    understanding the propensity nucleosomes at various distances have to loop with
    each other.

\section{Discussion}

We present a simplified model of the chromatin fiber that retains only the most
    basic geometrical and physical properties of a chain of nucleosomes
    connected by bare linker DNA.\@
By taking a fully analytical approach, we are able to outline the effects of
    linker length and its heterogeneity on the structure of the chromatin fiber.

Our model excludes various important facets of chromatin's structure.
Most strikingly, we ignore the steric interactions between nucleosomes that is
    well known~\cite{widom1992} to constrain the space of possible linker
    lengths.
In addition, our model ignores the finite size of the nucleosome, treating it as
    a point-like kink in the DNA backbone.

It is interesting to note that the helical wormlike chain has been employed
    in the past to explain the looping statistics of bare DNA~\cite{shimada1984,
    liu2011a}.
Along with the so-called ``kinked'' wormlike chain model~\cite{wiggins2005,
    popov2005}---where kinks are flexible, and represent melted base
    pairs---these models were created to explain the propensity for small DNA
    loops \textit{in vivo}.
Our model highlights that even without models of DNA more detailed than the WLC,
    the looping probabilites for short segments of DNA can be increased by
    orders of magnitude simply by the specific or non-specific binding of any
    protein that promotes a kink in the DNA.\@

    %TODO add this sentence into the flow somewhere around here
DNA is known to partially unwrap from the nucleosome core dynamically \textit{in
% I have tons of citations for these two statements in zotero, just have to
% separate them from each other tediously to make two lists
    vivo}, whether spontaneously (called nucleosome breathing~\cite{TODO}), due to
    force on the DNA~\cite{TODO}, or through active
    remodelling~\cite{dion2007,kulaeva2007,senavirathne2017}.

While these choices constrain the ability of our model to make predictions that
    can be tested \textit{in vivo}, our bottom-up approach allows us to
    formalize both new and existing intuition for how linker length affects the
    structure of the chromatin fiber in a unified framework.
% We hope that our framework will facilitate future analytical work that takes
%     these details, and many more, into account.
We expect that our central conclusions---that nucleosomes can modulate
    chromatin's elasticity and facilitate or prevent looping between distal loci
    through their positioning---will only gain nuance as these details are added
    to future analytical works.

While the quantitative values may yet change, we suspect that our estimate of
    chromatin's Kuhn length and looping probabilities will already provide
    guidance to future work relying on coarse-grained models of chromatin.
In particular we show that the common practice~\cite{macphersonInPress,nuebler2018}
    of using a Kuhn length of \SI{100}{\nano\metre}, simply because that is the
    Kuhn length of bare DNA, will likely lead to at least a four-fold
    overestimation of the polymer's stiffness.
In large-scale models of chromatin organization, this could mean the difference
    between heterochromatin and euchromatin segregation recapitulating
    \textit{in vivo} observations, and the chromosomes instead being uniformly
    distributed throughout the nucleus.

Finally, while our model has been designed specifically to address chromatin
    structure, we suspect that the intuition gained here will also apply more
    broadly to block copolymers in solution.
Typical block copolymers have a dihedral ``kink'' at the junctions between
    blocks, and our framework could easily be applied to any particular
    copolymer of interest to relate the elasticity and circularization
    propensity of the polymer to the the block size, analagously to linker
    length.

% \paragraph{Syntax}
% The argument of \verb+\cite+ may be a single \emph{key},
% or may consist of a comma-separated list of keys.
% The citation \emph{key} may contain
% letters, numbers, the dash (-) character, or the period (.) character.
% New with natbib 8.3 is an extension to the syntax that allows for

% The extra set of braces will keep \LaTeX\ out of trouble if your \emph{text} contains the comma (,) character.

% The star (*) modifier to the \emph{key} signifies that the reference is to be

% a common idiom in APS and AIP articles (see below, Ref.~[\onlinecite{epr}]).
% When references are merged in this way, they are separated by a semicolon instead of
% the period (full stop) that would otherwise appear.

% \paragraph{Eliding repeated information}
% When a reference is merged, some of its fields may be elided: for example,
% when the author matches that of the previous reference, it is omitted.
% If both author and journal match, both are omitted.
% If the journal matches, but the author does not, the journal is replaced by \emph{ibid.},
% as exemplified by Ref.~[\onlinecite{epr}].

% be in effect if the markup features of the APS and AIP Bib\TeX\ styles is employed.

% \paragraph{The options of the cite command itself}
% Please note that optional arguments to the \emph{key} change the reference in the bibliography,
% not the citation in the body of the document.
% For the latter, use the optional arguments of the \verb+\cite+ command itself:
