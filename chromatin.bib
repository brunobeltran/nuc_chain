  abstract = {Messenger RNA (mRNA) dynamics in single cells are often modeled as a memoryless birth-death process with a constant probability per unit time that an mRNA molecule is synthesized or degraded. This predicts a Poisson steady-state distribution of mRNA number, in close agreement with experiments. This is surprising, since mRNA decay is known to be a complex process. The paradox is resolved by realizing that the Poisson steady state generalizes to arbitrary mRNA lifetime distributions. A mapping between mRNA dynamics and queueing theory highlights an identifiability problem: a measured Poisson steady state is consistent with a large variety of microscopic models. Here, I provide a rigorous and intuitive explanation for the universality of the Poisson steady state. I show that the mRNA birth-death process and its complex decay variants all take the form of the familiar Poisson law of rare events, under a nonlinear rescaling of time. As a corollary, not only steady-states but also transients are Poisson distributed. Deviations from the Poisson form occur only under two conditions, promoter fluctuations leading to transcriptional bursts or nonindependent degradation of mRNA molecules. These results place severe limits on the power of single-cell experiments to probe microscopic mechanisms, and they highlight the need for single-molecule measurements.},

  abstract = {Studies of individual living cells have revealed that many transcription factors activate in dynamic, and often stochastic, pulses within the same cell. However, it has remained unclear whether cells might exploit the dynamic interaction of these pulses to control gene expression. Here, using quantitative single-cell time-lapse imaging of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that the pulsatile transcription factors Msn2 and Mig1 combinatorially regulate their target genes through modulation of their relative pulse timing. The activator Msn2 and repressor Mig1 showed pulsed activation in either a temporally overlapping or non-overlapping manner during their transient response to different inputs, with only the non-overlapping dynamics efficiently activating target gene expression. Similarly, under constant environmental conditions, where Msn2 and Mig1 exhibit sporadic pulsing, glucose concentration modulated the temporal overlap between pulses of the two factors. Together, these results reveal a time-based mode of combinatorial gene regulation. Regulation through relative signal timing is common in engineering and neurobiology, and these results suggest that it could also function broadly within the signalling and regulatory systems of the cell.},

Here, we review the recent progress in our understanding of how miRNAs mediate translational repression and mRNA decay, and discuss the contributions of the two silencing modes to the overall silencing effect in both kingdoms., Animal miRNAs promote mRNA decay by recruiting deadenylases and decapping factors onto the target mRNAs through GW182/TNRC6., Plant miRNAs do not promote deadenylation but cleave nearly perfectly complementary targets. The 3${'}$ end of the 5${'}$ fragment is uridylated, and both the 5${'}$ and 3${'}$ fragments are decayed by the 5${'}$-to-3${'}$ exoribonuclease., Animal miRNAs repress translation initiation by promoting dissociation of eIF4F through GW182-mediated displacement of PABP, recruitment of translational inhibitors via GW182, and displacement of the ATP-dependent RNA helicase eIF4A from the translation initiation complex eIF4F., Plant miRNAs repress translation via various organelle-bound factors.

  abstract = {The human gut harbors a large and complex community of beneficial microbes that remain stable over long periods. This stability is considered critical for good health but is poorly understood. Here we develop a body of ecological theory to help us understand microbiome stability. Although cooperating networks of microbes can be efficient, we find that they are often unstable. Counterintuitively, this finding indicates that hosts can benefit from microbial competition when this competition dampens cooperative networks and increases stability. More generally, stability is promoted by limiting positive feedbacks and weakening ecological interactions. We have analyzed host mechanisms for maintaining stability\textemdash{}including immune suppression, spatial structuring, and feeding of community members\textemdash{}and support our key predictions with recent data.
What makes the gut microbiome stable?
Classically, we think of our microbiome as stable, benign, and cooperative. Recent experimental work is beginning to unpick essential functions that can be attributed to the stable microbiota of humans. To be able to manipulate the microbiome to improve health, we need to understand community structure and composition and we need models to quantify and predict stability. Coyte et al. applied concepts and tools from community ecology to gut microbiome assembly. Independently developed models converged on a surprising answer: A high diversity of species is likely to coexist stably when the system is dominated by competitive, rather than cooperative, interactions.

  abstract = {Summary
Activity-dependent CREB phosphorylation and gene expression are critical for long-term neuronal plasticity. Local signaling at CaV1 channels triggers these events, but how information is relayed onward to the nucleus remains unclear. Here, we report a mechanism that mediates long-distance communication within cells: a shuttle that transports Ca2+/calmodulin from the surface membrane to the nucleus. We show that the shuttle protein is $\gamma$CaMKII, its phosphorylation at Thr287 by $\beta$CaMKII protects the Ca2+/CaM signal, and CaN triggers its nuclear translocation. Both $\beta$CaMKII and CaN act in close proximity to CaV1 channels, supporting their dominance, whereas $\gamma$CaMKII operates as a carrier, not as a kinase. Upon arrival within the nucleus, Ca2+/CaM activates CaMKK and its substrate CaMKIV, the CREB kinase. This mechanism resolves long-standing puzzles about CaM/CaMK-dependent signaling to the nucleus. The significance of the mechanism is emphasized by dysregulation of CaV1, $\gamma$CaMKII, $\beta$CaMKII, and CaN in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders.},

Using a unique combination of technologies that yields unprecedented statistical precision, we find that the sizes of individual Caulobacter crescentus cells increase exponentially in time. We also establish that they divide upon reaching a critical multiple ($\approx$1.8) of their initial sizes, rather than an absolute size. We show that when the temperature is varied, the growth and division timescales scale proportionally with each other over the physiological temperature range. Strikingly, the cell-size and division-time distributions can both be rescaled by their mean values such that the condition-specific distributions collapse to universal curves. We account for these observations with a minimal stochastic model that is based on an autocatalytic cycle. It predicts the scalings, as well as specific functional forms for the universal curves. Our experimental and theoretical analysis reveals a simple physical principle governing these complex biological processes: a single temperature-dependent scale of cellular time governs the stochastic dynamics of growth and division in balanced growth conditions.},

  abstract = {Recent imaging data for single bacterial cells reveal that their mean sizes grow exponentially in time and that their size distributions collapse to a single curve when rescaled by their means. An analogous result holds for the division-time distributions. A model is needed to delineate the minimal requirements for these scaling behaviors. We formulate a microscopic theory of stochastic exponential growth as a Master Equation that accounts for these observations, in contrast to existing quantitative models of stochastic exponential growth (e.g., the Black-Scholes equation or geometric Brownian motion). Our model, the stochastic Hinshelwood cycle (SHC), is an autocatalytic reaction cycle in which each molecular species catalyzes the production of the next. By finding exact analytical solutions to the SHC and the corresponding first passage time problem, we uncover universal signatures of fluctuations in exponential growth and division. The model makes minimal assumptions, and we describe how more complex reaction networks can reduce to such a cycle. We thus expect similar scalings to be discovered in stochastic processes resulting in exponential growth that appear in diverse contexts such as cosmology, finance, technology, and population growth.},

Recent technological advances have enabled elucidation of community diversity at high resolution. Investigation of microbial communities has revealed that they often contain multiple members with complementing and seemingly redundant metabolic capabilities. An understanding of the communal impacts of redundant metabolic capabilities is currently lacking; specifically, it is not known whether metabolic redundancy will foster competition or motivate cooperation. By investigating methanogenic populations, we identified the multidimensional interspecies interactions that define composition and dynamics within syntrophic communities that play a key role in the global carbon cycle. Species-specific genomes were extracted from metagenomic data using differential coverage binning. We used metabolic modeling leveraging metatranscriptomic information to reveal and quantify a complex intertwined system of syntrophic relationships. Our results show that amino acid auxotrophies create additional interdependencies that define community composition and control carbon and energy flux through the system while simultaneously contributing to overall community robustness. Strategic use of antimicrobials further reinforces this intricate interspecies network. Collectively, our study reveals the multidimensional interactions in syntrophic communities that promote high species richness and bolster community stability during environmental perturbations.},

  abstract = {Learning an algorithm from examples is a fundamental problem that has been widely studied. Recently it has been addressed using neural networks, in particular by Neural Turing Machines (NTMs). These are fully differentiable computers that use backpropagation to learn their own programming. Despite their appeal NTMs have a weakness that is caused by their sequential nature: they cannot be parallelized and are are hard to train due to their large depth when unfolded. We present a neural network architecture to address this problem: the Neural GPU. It is based on a type of convolutional gated recurrent unit and, like the NTM, is computationally universal. Unlike the NTM, the Neural GPU is highly parallel which makes it easier to train and efficient to run. An essential property of algorithms is their ability to handle inputs of arbitrary size. We show that the Neural GPU can be trained on short instances of an algorithmic task and successfully generalize to long instances. We verified it on a number of tasks including long addition and long multiplication of numbers represented in binary. We train the Neural GPU on numbers with upto 20 bits and observe no errors whatsoever while testing it, even on much longer numbers. To achieve these results we introduce a technique for training deep recurrent networks: parameter sharing relaxation. We also found a small amount of dropout and gradient noise to have a large positive effect on learning and generalization.},

We observe that although the retina adapts to a number of complex statistics, many of these may be explained by local adaptation to the mean signal strength at that stage. Second, ganglion cells signal the detection of a diverse set of features. Recent results indicate that feature selectivity arises through the action of specific inhibition, rather than through the convergence of excitation as in classical cortical models. Finally, the retina conveys predictions about the stimulus, a function usually attributed only to the higher brain. We expect that computational and mechanistic rules associated with these classes of functions will be an important guide in the study of other neural circuits.},

  abstract = {Computation in the brain involves multiple types of neurons, yet the organizing principles for how these neurons work together remain unclear. Information theory has offered explanations for how different types of neurons can maximize the transmitted information by encoding different stimulus features. However, recent experiments indicate that separate neuronal types exist that encode the same filtered version of the stimulus, but then the different cell types signal the presence of that stimulus feature with different thresholds. Here we show that the emergence of these neuronal types can be quantitatively described by the theory of transitions between different phases of matter. The two key parameters that control the separation of neurons into subclasses are the mean and standard deviation (SD) of noise affecting neural responses. The average noise across the neural population plays the role of temperature in the classic theory of phase transitions, whereas the SD is equivalent to pressure or magnetic field, in the case of liquid\textendash{}gas and magnetic transitions, respectively. Our results account for properties of two recently discovered types of salamander Off retinal ganglion cells, as well as the absence of multiple types of On cells. We further show that, across visual stimulus contrasts, retinal circuits continued to operate near the critical point whose quantitative characteristics matched those expected near a liquid\textendash{}gas critical point and described by the nearest-neighbor Ising model in three dimensions. By operating near a critical point, neural circuits can maximize information transmission in a given environment while retaining the ability to quickly adapt to a new environment.},

We use recent data on noise levels in gene expression to show that it should be possible to transmit much more than just one regulatory bit. Realizing this optimal information capacity would require that the dynamic range of TF concentrations used by the cell, the input/output relation of the regulatory module, and the noise in gene expression satisfy certain matching relations, which we derive. These results provide parameter-free, quantitative predictions connecting independently measurable quantities. Although we have considered only the simplified problem of a single gene responding to a single TF, we find that these predictions are in surprisingly good agreement with recent experiments on the Bicoid/Hunchback system in the early Drosophila embryo and that this system achieves $\sim$90\% of its theoretical maximum information transmission.},

However, the mechanisms by which \aa{}ngstr\"om-scale molecular properties are translated to micrometre-scale macroscopic properties are not well understood. Here we show that interactions between diverse synthetic, multivalent macromolecules (including multi-domain proteins and RNA) produce sharp liquid\textendash{}liquid-demixing phase separations, generating micrometre-sized liquid droplets in aqueous solution. This macroscopic transition corresponds to a molecular transition between small complexes and large, dynamic supramolecular polymers. The concentrations needed for phase transition are directly related to the valency of the interacting species. In the case of the actin-regulatory protein called neural Wiskott\textendash{}Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) interacting with its established biological partners NCK and phosphorylated nephrin, the phase transition corresponds to a sharp increase in activity towards an actin nucleation factor, the Arp2/3 complex. The transition is governed by the degree of phosphorylation of nephrin, explaining how this property of the system can be controlled to regulatory effect by kinases. The widespread occurrence of multivalent systems suggests that phase transitions may be used to spatially organize and biochemically regulate information throughout biology.},

  abstract = {16S ribosomal RNA currently represents the most important target of study in bacterial ecology. Its use for the description of bacterial diversity is, however, limited by the presence of variable copy numbers in bacterial genomes and sequence variation within closely related taxa or within a genome. Here we use the information from sequenced bacterial genomes to explore the variability of 16S rRNA sequences and copy numbers at various taxonomic levels and apply it to estimate bacterial genome and DNA abundances. In total, 7,081 16S rRNA sequences were in silico extracted from 1,690 available bacterial genomes (1\textendash{}15 per genome). While there are several phyla containing low 16S rRNA copy numbers, in certain taxa, e.g., the Firmicutes and Gammaproteobacteria, the variation is large. Genome sizes are more conserved at all tested taxonomic levels than 16S rRNA copy numbers. Only a minority of bacterial genomes harbors identical 16S rRNA gene copies, and sequence diversity increases with increasing copy numbers. While certain taxa harbor dissimilar 16S rRNA genes, others contain sequences common to multiple species. Sequence identity clusters (often termed operational taxonomic units) thus provide an imperfect representation of bacterial taxa of a certain phylogenetic rank. We have demonstrated that the information on 16S rRNA copy numbers and genome sizes of genome-sequenced bacteria may be used as an estimate for the closest related taxon in an environmental dataset to calculate alternative estimates of the relative abundance of individual bacterial taxa in environmental samples. Using an example from forest soil, this procedure would increase the abundance estimates of Acidobacteria and decrease these of Firmicutes. Using the currently available information, alternative estimates of bacterial community composition may be obtained in this way if the variation of 16S rRNA copy numbers among bacteria is considered.},

Phase separation is promoted by low salt concentrations or RNA. Over time, the droplets mature to more stable states, as assessed by slowed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and resistance to salt. Maturation often coincides with formation of fibrous structures. Different disordered domains can co-assemble into phase-separated droplets. These biophysical properties demonstrate a plausible mechanism by~which interactions between disordered regions, coupled with RNA binding, could contribute to RNP granule assembly in~vivo through promoting phase separation. Progression from dynamic liquids to stable fibers may be regulated to produce cellular structures with diverse physiochemical properties and functions. Misregulation could contribute to diseases involving aberrant RNA granules.},

Secondary metabolite biosynthesis in microorganisms responds to discrete chemical and biological stimuli; however, untargeted identification of these responses presents a significant challenge.

Self-organizing map (SOM) analytics adapted for metabolomic data demonstrate efficient characterization of the subsets of primary and secondary metabolites that respond similarly across stimuli. Over 60\% of all metabolic features inventoried from responses are either not observed under control conditions or produced at greater than 2-fold increase in abundance in response to at least one of the multiplexing conditions, reflecting how metabolites encode phenotypic changes in an organism responding to multiplexed challenges. Using abundance as an additional filter, each of 16 known S.~coelicolor secondary metabolites is prioritized via SOM and observed at increased levels (1.2- to 22-fold compared with unperturbed) in response to one or more challenge conditions.},

We uncover that the timing of chromosome splitting is not determined by reaching a fixed securin level, but that this level adapts to the securin degradation kinetics. In conjunction with securin and cyclin B~competing for degradation during anaphase, this~provides robustness to the temporal order of anaphase events.

Many animals have evolved the ability to estimate the speed and direction of visual motion. They use these estimates to judge their own motion, so that they can navigate through an environment, and to judge how other animals are moving, which allows them to avoid predators or detect prey.
In the 1950s, a physicist and a biologist used measurements of beetle behavior in response to visual stimuli to develop a model for how the brain estimates motion. The model became known as the Hassenstein-Reichardt correlator (HRC). The HRC and related models accurately predict the behavioral and neural responses of insects and mammals to many types of motion stimuli.
However, there are visual stimuli that generate motion percepts in fruit flies (and humans) that cannot be accounted for by the HRC. Are these differences between real brains and the HRC simply imperfections in visual circuits, whose neurons cannot perform idealized mathematical operations, or are these deviations intentional, somehow improving motion estimates? In other words: are the observed deviations a bug or a feature of visual circuits?
To address this question, Fitzgerald and Clark evaluated how different models of motion detection performed when presented with natural scenes. Natural scenes are fundamentally different from most stimuli used in lab, since they contain a rich set of regularities that are not present in simple stimuli. Fitzgerald and Clark compared the ability of the HRC, along with new, more general models, to estimate the speed and direction at which images moved across a screen. This revealed that many models could out-perform the HRC by taking advantage of regularities in natural scenes. Those models that were tuned to perform well with natural scenes could also predict the paradoxical motion percepts that were not predicted by the HRC. This suggests that visual circuits may have evolved to perform well with natural inputs, and the paradoxical motion percepts represent a feature of the real circuit, rather than a bug.
Models that performed well with natural inputs treated light and dark visual information differently. This different treatment of light and dark is a property of most visual systems, but not of the HRC or related models. In the future, these models of motion processing may help us understand how biological details of the fruit fly's visual circuits help it to estimate motion.

Here we describe PICRUSt (phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states), a computational approach to predict the functional composition of a metagenome using marker gene data and a database of reference genomes. PICRUSt uses an extended ancestral-state reconstruction algorithm to predict which gene families are present and then combines gene families to estimate the composite metagenome. Using 16S information, PICRUSt recaptures key findings from the Human Microbiome Project and accurately predicts the abundance of gene families in host-associated and environmental communities, with quantifiable uncertainty. Our results demonstrate that phylogeny and function are sufficiently linked that this 'predictive metagenomic' approach should provide useful insights into the thousands of uncultivated microbial communities for which only marker gene surveys are currently available.},

Here, we use optogenetics to investigate how the pluripotency network in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) achieves a robust response to differentiation cues but not to gene expression fluctuations. We engineered mouse ESCs to allow quantitative control over the endogenous mechanism of~neural differentiation through a light-inducible Brn2~transgene and monitored differentiation status through a genome-integrated Nanog-GFP reporter. By exposing cells to pulses of Brn2, we find that the pluripotency network rejects Brn2 inputs that are below specific magnitude or duration thresholds, but allows rapid differentiation when both thresholds are satisfied. The filtering properties of the network arise through its positive feedback architecture and the intrinsic half-life of Nanog, which determines the duration threshold in the network. Together our results suggest that the dynamic properties of positive feedback networks might determine how inputs are classified as signal or noise by stem cells.},

  abstract = {Gene regulatory networks are multistable dynamical systems in which attractor states represent cell phenotypes. Spontaneous, noise-induced transitions between these states are thought to underlie critical cellular processes, including cell developmental fate decisions, phenotypic plasticity in fluctuating environments, and carcinogenesis. As such, there is increasing interest in the development of theoretical and computational approaches that can shed light on the dynamics of these stochastic state transitions in multistable gene networks. We applied a numerical rare-event sampling algorithm to study transition paths of spontaneous noise-induced switching for a ubiquitous gene regulatory network motif, the bistable toggle switch, in which two mutually repressive genes compete for dominant expression. We find that the method can efficiently uncover detailed switching mechanisms that involve fluctuations both in occupancies of DNA regulatory sites and copy numbers of protein products. In addition, we show that the rate parameters governing binding and unbinding of regulatory proteins to DNA strongly influence the switching mechanism. In a regime of slow DNA-binding/unbinding kinetics, spontaneous switching occurs relatively frequently and is driven primarily by fluctuations in DNA-site occupancies. In contrast, in a regime of fast DNA-binding/unbinding kinetics, switching occurs rarely and is driven by fluctuations in levels of expressed protein. Our results demonstrate how spontaneous cell phenotype transitions involve collective behavior of both regulatory proteins and DNA. Computational approaches capable of simulating dynamics over many system variables are thus well suited to exploring dynamic mechanisms in gene networks.},

Emerging mutations exhibit strong beneficial effects in healthy hosts but substantial antagonistic pleiotropy in immune-deficient mice.

  abstract = {Cellular circuits sense the environment, process signals, and compute decisions using networks of interacting proteins. To model such a system, the abundance of each activated protein species can be described as a stochastic function of the abundance of other proteins. High-dimensional single-cell technologies, such as mass cytometry, offer an opportunity to characterize signaling circuit-wide. However, the challenge of developing and applying computational approaches to interpret such complex data remains. Here, we developed computational methods, based on established statistical concepts, to characterize signaling network relationships by quantifying the strengths of network edges and deriving signaling response functions. In comparing signaling between na\"ive and antigen-exposed CD4+ T lymphocytes, we find that although these two cell subtypes had similarly wired networks, na\"ive cells transmitted more information along a key signaling cascade than did antigen-exposed cells. We validated our characterization on mice lacking the extracellular-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK2, which showed stronger influence of pERK on pS6 (phosphorylated-ribosomal protein S6), in na\"ive cells as compared with antigen-exposed cells, as predicted. We demonstrate that by using cell-to-cell variation inherent in single-cell data, we can derive response functions underlying molecular circuits and drive the understanding of how cells process signals.
Introduction Cellular circuits sense the environment, process signals, and compute decisions using networks of interacting proteins. Emerging high-dimensional single-cell technologies such as mass cytometry can measure dozens of protein epitopes simultaneously in millions of individual cells. With thousands of individual cells, each providing a point of data on co-occurring protein states, it is possible to infer and quantify the functional forms of the relationships between proteins. However, in practice these underlying relationships are typically obscured by statistical limitations of the data, hence rendering the analysis and interpretation of single-cell data challenging. We developed computational methods, tailored to single-cell data, to more completely define the function and strength of signaling relationships.
Quantitative characterization of T cell signaling. (A) The pCD3$\zeta$-pSLP76 signaling interaction shown as (I) a scatterplot, (II) a kernel density estimate, and (III) by using a conditional DREVI method. (IV) Shape features are extracted and quantified. (B) DREVI plots of a signaling cascade downstream of TCR show the time-varying nature of edge shapes and strengths. (C) Edge strengths are quantified by use of conditional DREMI.
Rationale We demonstrate the utility of our methods using single-cell data collected from T cells. Although T cell subpopulations are phenotypically delineated into several cell subsets\textemdash{}such as regulatory, effector, and memory\textemdash{}and are thought to have similarly wired signaling networks, their responses to activation differ in ways that are not understood.
Results We used mass cytometry to measure the abundance of 20 internal and surface protein epitopes, at 13 time points, after two different types of TCR activation in T cells of B6 mice\textemdash{}resulting in more than 2 million data points. To study TCR signaling, we developed conditional-Density Resampled Estimate of Mutual Information (DREMI) to quantify the strengths of the influence that a protein X has on protein Y, and conditional-Density Rescaled Visualization (DREVI) to visualize and characterize the edge-response function underlying their molecular interaction. A key conceptual shift in DREMI and DREVI is our use of the conditional probability of Y | X rather than the joint probability of X and Y. We show that the consensus Y-response for each value of X is much easier to identify in the conditional density estimate, especially when the joint density is concentrated in a narrow range, which is typical of such data (Fig. 1A). We used DREMI to characterize the rapid dynamics of signaling interactions upon TCR activation (Fig. 1B) and show that the strength of signal transfer peaks in canonical pathway order (Fig. 1C). We compared edges in naive and antigen-exposed CD4+ T cells and identified differential signal transmission along a key signaling cascade that starts at pCD3$\zeta$ and continues through pSLP76, pERK, and pS6. At each stage in this cascade, more information (higher DREMI) is transferred downstream from one protein to another, over a longer time period, in na\"ive cells than in antigen-exposed cells. We validated our characterization in mice lacking the extracellular-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK2), demonstrating stronger influence of pERK on pS6 in naive cells, as predicted.
Conclusion DREMI solves a challenging problem: quantifying the strength of the underlying complex relationships between proteins from noisy data. Our approach reveals how signaling is fine-tuned between T cell subpopulations: The differences we identified between na\"ive and antigen-exposed T cells suggest that na\"ive cells more sensitively transmit upstream signaling inputs along a key signaling cascade. In contrast, trained effector or memory cells seem poised for fast responses upon repeated exposure. DREVI and DREMI are broadly applicable across biological systems and single-cell technologies. As single-cell data become more abundant, our methods will enable the construction of quantitative models of cellular signaling and comparison between healthy and diseased cells.

Deciphering information flow in T cells
We can now measure the activation state of multiple components of biochemical signaling pathways in single cells. This ability reveals how information flows through such cellular regulatory pathways and how it is altered in disease. Krishnaswamy et al. applied statistical techniques to overcome the complexity and variation (or noise) in such single-cell measurements. They used these techniques to quantify information transfer between proteins that participate in antigen recognition in cells of the immune system. The methods should prove useful in analysis of other signaling circuits to enhance basic understanding and reveal potential therapeutic targets to fight disease.

Many animals have evolved the ability to estimate the speed and direction of visual motion. They use these estimates to judge their own motion, so that they can navigate through an environment, and to judge how other animals are moving, which allows them to avoid predators or detect prey.
In the 1950s, a physicist and a biologist used measurements of beetle behavior in response to visual stimuli to develop a model for how the brain estimates motion. The model became known as the Hassenstein-Reichardt correlator (HRC). The HRC and related models accurately predict the behavioral and neural responses of insects and mammals to many types of motion stimuli.
However, there are visual stimuli that generate motion percepts in fruit flies (and humans) that cannot be accounted for by the HRC. Are these differences between real brains and the HRC simply imperfections in visual circuits, whose neurons cannot perform idealized mathematical operations, or are these deviations intentional, somehow improving motion estimates? In other words: are the observed deviations a bug or a feature of visual circuits?
To address this question, Fitzgerald and Clark evaluated how different models of motion detection performed when presented with natural scenes. Natural scenes are fundamentally different from most stimuli used in lab, since they contain a rich set of regularities that are not present in simple stimuli. Fitzgerald and Clark compared the ability of the HRC, along with new, more general models, to estimate the speed and direction at which images moved across a screen. This revealed that many models could out-perform the HRC by taking advantage of regularities in natural scenes. Those models that were tuned to perform well with natural scenes could also predict the paradoxical motion percepts that were not predicted by the HRC. This suggests that visual circuits may have evolved to perform well with natural inputs, and the paradoxical motion percepts represent a feature of the real circuit, rather than a bug.
Models that performed well with natural inputs treated light and dark visual information differently. This different treatment of light and dark is a property of most visual systems, but not of the HRC or related models. In the future, these models of motion processing may help us understand how biological details of the fruit fly's visual circuits help it to estimate motion.

  abstract = {During the early development of Xenopus laevis embryos, the first mitotic cell cycle is long ($\sim$85 min) and the subsequent 11 cycles are short ($\sim$30 min) and clock-like. Here we address the question of how the Cdk1 cell cycle oscillator changes between these two modes of operation. We found that the change can be attributed to an alteration in the balance between Wee1/Myt1 and Cdc25. The change in balance converts a circuit that acts like a positive-plus-negative feedback oscillator, with spikes of Cdk1 activation, to one that acts like a negative-feedback-only oscillator, with a shorter period and smoothly varying Cdk1 activity. Shortening the first cycle, by treating embryos with the Wee1A/Myt1 inhibitor PD0166285, resulted in a dramatic reduction in embryo viability, and restoring the length of the first cycle in inhibitor-treated embryos with low doses of cycloheximide partially rescued viability. Computations with an experimentally parameterized mathematical model show that modest changes in the Wee1/Cdc25 ratio can account for the observed qualitative changes in the cell cycle. The high ratio in the first cycle allows the period to be long and tunable, and decreasing the ratio in the subsequent cycles allows the oscillator to run at a maximal speed. Thus, the embryo rewires its feedback regulation to meet two different developmental requirements during early development., The early embryonic cell cycles, which initiate cell division, mark the beginning of the life of an organism. Across different phyla, these cycles have a characteristic temporal pattern, with the first cycle being long and the subsequent cycles shorter, leading to rapid increase in cell numbers. Here we have made use of the Xenopus laevis embryos to study the mechanism and significance of this temporal transition. In X. laevis embryos, the cell cycles are driven by oscillations in the activity of the cyclin B\textendash{}Cdk1 complex, which regulates cell cycle progression by protein phosphorylation. We quantified the oscillatory dynamics of key regulators in the first few embryonic cell cycles, and developed an experimentally parameterized mathematical model of the oscillations. We found that a change in the balance between the Cdk1-activating phosphatase Cdc25 and the Cdk1-inhibiting kinases Wee1 and Myt1 is critical for this transition. Tuning this balance converts the cyclin B\textendash{}Cdk1 oscillator from generating spiky oscillations with delayed activation, to smooth-varying oscillations with a shorter period. Moreover, we found that it is crucial for the first embryonic cell cycle to be sufficiently long, as shortening it with drugs dramatically decreases embryo viability. Our work shows how X. laevis embryos modulate their cell cycle oscillator dynamics to meet two developmental requirements: a sufficiently long first cell cycle and rapid progression of the subsequent cycles.},

  abstract = {Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation play a fundamental role in eukaryotic signaling. Some 30\% of proteins are phosphorylated at any time, many on multiple sites, raising the question of how the cellular phosphorylation state is regulated. Previous work for one and two phosphorylation sites has revealed mechanisms, such as distributive phosphorylation, for switch-like regulation of maximally phosphorylated phosphoforms. These insights have led to the influential view that more phosphorylation sites leads to steeper switching, as proposed for substrates like cyclin E and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1. An analytical study of the ordered distributive case reveals a more complex story. Multisite phosphorylation creates an efficient threshold: The proportion of maximally phosphorylated substrate is maintained close to 0 when the ratio of kinase to phosphatase activity lies below a suitable threshold, and this threshold increases with increasing numbers of sites, n. However, above the threshold, the response may not always abruptly switch between 0 and 1, as would be the case for an efficient switch, but may increase in a gradual manner, which becomes more hyperbolic with increasing n. Abrupt switching cannot be attributed merely to n being large. We point out that conventional measures of ultrasensitivity must be modified to discriminate between thresholding and switching; we discuss additional factors that influence switching efficiency and suggest new directions for experimental investigation.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

Using an in~vitro ``aging'' experiment, we demonstrate that liquid droplets of FUS protein convert with time from a liquid to an aggregated state, and this conversion is accelerated by patient-derived mutations. We conclude that the physiological role of FUS requires forming dynamic liquid-like compartments.

Def1 processing results in the removal of a domain promoting cytoplasmic localization, resulting in nuclear accumulation of the clipped protein. Nuclear Def1 then binds RNAPII, utilizing a ubiquitin-binding domain to recruit the Elongin-Cullin E3 ligase complex via a ubiquitin-homology~domain in the Ela1 protein. This facilitates polyubiquitylation of Rpb1, triggering its proteasome-mediated degradation. Together, these results outline the multistep mechanism of Rpb1 polyubiquitylation triggered by transcription stress and uncover the key role played by Def1 as a facilitator of Elongin-Cullin ubiquitin ligase function.},

Elongation is particularly affected, with RECQL5 depletion causing a striking increase in the average rate, concurrent with increased stalling, pausing, arrest, and/or backtracking (transcription stress). RECQL5 therefore controls~the movement of RNAPII across genes. Loss of RECQL5 also results in the loss or gain of genomic regions, with the breakpoints of lost regions located in genes and common fragile sites.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dynamic Flux Balance Analysis (DFBA) is a dynamic simulation framework for biochemical processes. DFBA can be performed using different approaches such as static optimization (SOA), dynamic optimization (DOA), and direct approaches (DA). Few existing simulators address the theoretical and practical challenges of nonunique exchange fluxes or infeasible linear programs (LPs). Both are common sources of failure and inefficiencies for these simulators.
RESULTS: DFBAlab, a MATLAB-based simulator that uses the LP feasibility problem to obtain an extended system and lexicographic optimization to yield unique exchange fluxes, is presented. DFBAlab is able to simulate complex dynamic cultures with multiple species rapidly and reliably, including differential-algebraic equation (DAE) systems. In addition, DFBAlab's running time scales linearly with the number of species models. Three examples are presented where the performance of COBRA, DyMMM and DFBAlab are compared.
CONCLUSIONS: Lexicographic optimization is used to determine unique exchange fluxes which are necessary for a well-defined dynamic system. DFBAlab does not fail during numerical integration due to infeasible LPs. The extended system obtained through the LP feasibility problem in DFBAlab provides a penalty function that can be used in optimization algorithms.},

  abstract = {The increasing availability of the genome sequences of microorganisms involved in important bioremediation processes makes it feasible to consider developing genome-scale models that can aid in predicting the likely outcome of potential subsurface bioremediation strategies. Previous studies of the in situ bioremediation of uranium-contaminated groundwater have demonstrated that Geobacter species are often the dominant members of the groundwater community during active bioremediation and the primary organisms catalysing U(VI) reduction. Therefore, a genome-scale, constraint-based model of the metabolism of Geobacter sulfurreducens was coupled with the reactive transport model HYDROGEOCHEM in an attempt to model in situ uranium bioremediation. In order to simplify the modelling, the influence of only three growth factors was considered: acetate, the electron donor added to stimulate U(VI) reduction; Fe(III), the electron acceptor primarily supporting growth of Geobacter; and ammonium, a key nutrient. The constraint-based model predicted that growth yields of Geobacter varied significantly based on the availability of these three growth factors and that there are minimum thresholds of acetate and Fe(III) below which growth and activity are not possible. This contrasts with typical, empirical microbial models that assume fixed growth yields and the possibility for complete metabolism of the substrates. The coupled genome-scale and reactive transport model predicted acetate concentrations and U(VI) reduction rates in a field trial of in situ uranium bioremediation that were comparable to the predictions of a calibrated conventional model, but without the need for empirical calibration, other than specifying the initial biomass of Geobacter. These results suggest that coupling genome-scale metabolic models with reactive transport models may be a good approach to developing models that can be truly predictive, without empirical calibration, for evaluating the probable response of subsurface microorganisms to possible bioremediation approaches prior to implementation.},

Short- and long-distance circadian communication is~essential for integration of temporal information. However, a major challenge in plant biology is to decipher how individual clocks are interconnected to sustain rhythms in the whole plant. Here we show that the shoot apex is composed of an ensemble of coupled clocks that influence rhythms in roots. Live-imaging of single cells, desynchronization of dispersed protoplasts, and mathematical analysis using barycentric coordinates for high-dimensional space show a gradation in the strength of circadian communication in different tissues, with shoot apex clocks displaying the highest coupling. The increased synchrony confers robustness of morning and evening oscillations and particular capabilities for phase readjustments. Rhythms in roots are altered by shoot apex ablation and micrografting, suggesting that signals from the shoot apex are able to synchronize distal organs. Similarly to the mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus, shoot apexes play a dominant role within the plant hierarchical circadian structure.},

Many genes code for proteins that carry out essential tasks. The instructions in a gene are first copied into a messenger RNA (mRNA), and a molecular machine known as a ribosome reads the copied instructions in groups of three letters at a time (called codons). The ribosome translates the order of the codons into a sequence of amino acids; each amino acid is carried into the ribosome by a transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule. As it translates, the ribosome joins each new amino acid to the one before it, like the links in a chain. Finally, the newly built protein chain passes through a tunnel to exit the ribosome. Ribosomes do not build all proteins at a constant rate; there are many examples of proteins that stall when they are in the ribosome exit tunnel. It is thought that this stalling is an important way for cells to control the expression of proteins.
SecM is a bacterial protein that stalls while it is being made. Previous research has shown that a sequence of amino acids in SecM (called the arrest sequence) interacts with components of the ribosome tunnel. This interaction leads to stalling, and regulates the translation of another important bacterial protein (called SecA) that is encoded downstream on the same mRNA as SecM. If SecM-induced stalling takes place, the translation of SecA actually increases. Nevertheless, it remains poorly understood how SecM stalls in the ribosome.
Zhang et al. have now solved the structures of SecM proteins stalled inside ribosomes using a method called cryo-electron microscopy. This approach identified two different states of SecM present in the ribosome, which corresponded to two different stalling mechanisms.
The addition of an amino acid to a growing protein occurs in stages. First, the tRNA that carries the amino acid to the ribosome and bind to it in a region known as the A-site. After this, the tRNA moves to the P-site where the attached amino acid is incorporated into the elongating protein chain. Zhang et al. observed that the arrest sequence of SecM and the ribosome tunnel interact extensively. These interactions are strong and alter the configuration of both the A-site and P-site of the ribosome. This has two major consequences for translation. First, the tRNA cannot be stably accommodated in the A-site and secondly, its passage to the P-site is slowed down. Both these mechanisms contribute to stalling.
This study provides a detailed analysis of how the ribosome can adjust to control translation. It also highlights that codon-specific control of translation constitutes an important component of how gene expression is regulated.

  abstract = {The gut microbiota is essential for numerous aspects of human health. However, the underlying mechanisms of many host-microbiota interactions remain unclear. The aim of this study was to characterize effects of the microbiota on host epithelium using a novel ex vivo model based on mouse ileal organoids. We have explored the transcriptional response of organoids upon exposure to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and products generated by two abundant microbiota constituents, Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. We observed that A. muciniphila metabolites affect various transcription factors and genes involved in cellular lipid metabolism and growth, supporting previous in vivo findings. Contrastingly, F. prausnitzii products exerted only weak effects on host transcription. Additionally, A. muciniphila and its metabolite propionate modulated expression of Fiaf, Gpr43, histone deacetylases (HDACs), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (Ppar$\gamma$), important regulators of transcription factor regulation, cell cycle control, lipolysis, and satiety. This work illustrates that specific bacteria and their metabolites differentially modulate epithelial transcription in mouse organoids. We demonstrate that intestinal organoids provide a novel and powerful ex vivo model for host-microbiome interaction studies.
IMPORTANCE We investigated the influence of the gut microbiota and microbially produced short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) on gut functioning. Many commensal bacteria in the gut produce SCFAs, particularly butyrate, acetate, and propionate, which have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal disorders. Organoids\textemdash{}small crypt-villus structures grown from ileal intestinal stem cells\textemdash{}were exposed to SCFAs and two specific gut bacteria. Akkermansia muciniphila, found in the intestinal mucus, was recently shown to have a favorable effect on the disrupted metabolism associated with obesity. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is a commensal gut bacterium, the absence of which may be associated with Crohn's disease. We showed that in our model, A. muciniphila induces stronger effects on the host than F. prausnitzii. We observed that A. muciniphila and propionate affect the expression of genes involved in host lipid metabolism and epigenetic activation or silencing of gene expression. We demonstrated that organoids provide a powerful tool for host-microbe interaction studies.},

Ninety-four bacterial consortia of diverse size, randomly drawn from the culture collection, were introduced into germ-free animals. We identified an unanticipated range of bacterial strains that promoted accumulation of colonic regulatory T cells (Tregs) and expansion of Nrp1lo/- peripheral Tregs, as well as strains that modulated mouse adiposity and cecal metabolite concentrations, using feature selection algorithms and follow-up monocolonizations. This combinatorial approach enables a systems-level understanding of microbial contributions to human biology.

  doi = {10.1186/s13059-015-0646-9},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene content differences in human gut microbes can lead to inter-individual phenotypic variations such as digestive capacity. It is unclear whether gene content variation is caused by differences in microbial species composition or by the presence of different strains of the same species; the extent of gene content variation in the latter is unknown. Unlike pan-genome studies of cultivable strains, the use of metagenomic data can provide an unbiased view of structural variation of gut bacterial strains by measuring them in their natural habitats, the gut of each individual in this case, representing native boundaries between gut bacterial populations. We analyzed publicly available metagenomic data from fecal samples to characterize inter-individual variation in gut bacterial species.
RESULTS: A comparison of 11 abundant gut bacterial species showed that the gene content of strains from the same species differed, on average, by 13\% between individuals. This number is based on gene deletions only and represents a lower limit, yet the variation is already in a similar range as observed between completely sequenced strains of cultivable species. We show that accessory genes that differ considerably between individuals can encode important functions, such as polysaccharide utilization and capsular polysaccharide synthesis loci.
CONCLUSION: Metagenomics can yield insights into gene content variation of strains in complex communities, which cannot be predicted by phylogenetic marker genes alone. The large degree of inter-individual variability in gene content implies that strain resolution must be considered in order to fully assess the functional potential of an individual's human gut microbiome.},

  abstract = {Defining the functional status of host-associated microbial ecosystems has proven challenging owing to the vast number of predicted genes within the microbiome and relatively poor understanding of community dynamics and community-host interaction. Metabolomic approaches, in which a large number of small molecule metabolites can be defined in a biological sample, offer a promising avenue to 'fingerprint' microbiota functional status. Here, we examined the effects of the human gut microbiota on the fecal and urinary metabolome of a humanized (HUM) mouse using an optimized ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based method. Differences between HUM and conventional mouse urine and fecal metabolomic profiles support host-specific aspects of the microbiota's metabolomic contribution, consistent with distinct microbial compositions. Comparison of microbiota composition and metabolome of mice humanized with different human donors revealed that the vast majority of metabolomic features observed in donor samples are produced in the corresponding HUM mice, and individual-specific features suggest 'personalized' aspects of functionality can be reconstituted in mice. Feeding the mice a defined, custom diet resulted in modification of the metabolite signatures, illustrating that host diet provides an avenue for altering gut microbiota functionality, which in turn can be monitored via metabolomics. Using a defined model microbiota consisting of one or two species, we show that simplified communities can drive major changes in the host metabolomic profile. Our results demonstrate that metabolomics constitutes a powerful avenue for functional characterization of the intestinal microbiota and its interaction with the host.},

  abstract = {Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) is associated with severe gastrointestinal disease. Upon entering the gastrointestinal tract, EHEC is exposed to a fluctuating environment and a myriad of other bacterial species. To establish an infection, EHEC strains have to modulate their gene expression according to the GI tract environment. In order to explore the interspecies interactions between EHEC and an human intestinal commensal, the global gene expression profile was determined of EHEC O103:H25 (EHEC NIPH-11060424) co-cultured with B. thetaiotaomicron (CCUG 10774) or grown in the presence of spent medium from B. thetaiotaomicron. Microarray analysis revealed that approximately 1\% of the EHEC NIPH-11060424 genes were significantly up-regulated both in co-culture (30 genes) and in the presence of spent medium (44 genes), and that the affected genes differed between the two conditions. In co-culture, genes encoding structural components of the type three secretion system were among the most affected genes with an almost 4-fold up-regulation, while the most affected genes in spent medium were involved in chemotaxis and were more than 3-fold up-regulated. The operons for type three secretion system (TTSS) are located on the Locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island, and qPCR showed that genes of all five operons (LEE1-LEE5) were up-regulated. Moreover, an increased adherence to HeLa cells was observed in EHEC NIPH-11060424 exposed to B. thetaiotaomicron. Expression of stx2 genes, encoding the main virulence factor of EHEC, was down-regulated in both conditions (co-culture/spent medium). These results show that expression of EHEC genes involved in colonization and virulence is modulated in response to direct interspecies contact between cells, or to diffusible factors released from B. thetaiotaomicron. Such interspecies interactions could allow the pathogen to recognize its predilection site and modulate its behaviour accordingly, thus increasing the efficiency of colonization of the colon mucosa, facilitating its persistence and increasing its virulence potential.},

To date, a systematic approach for describing inter-species interactions has been lacking. Here we independently predict the competitive and cooperative potential between 6,903 bacterial pairs derived from a collection of 118 species' metabolic models. We chart an intricate association between competition and cooperation indicating that the cooperative potential is maximized at moderate levels of resource overlap. Utilizing ecological data from 2,801 samples, we explore the associations between bacterial interactions and coexistence patterns. The high level of competition observed between species with mutual-exclusive distribution patterns supports the role of competition in community assembly. Cooperative interactions are typically unidirectional with no obvious benefit to the giver. However, within their natural communities, bacteria typically form close cooperative loops resulting in indirect benefit to all species involved. These findings are important for the future design of consortia optimized towards bioremediation and bio-production applications.},

The complex, interconnected architecture of cell-signaling networks makes it challenging to disentangle how cells process extracellular information to make decisions. We have developed an optogenetic approach to selectively activate isolated intracellular signaling nodes with light and use this method to follow the flow of information from the signaling protein Ras. By measuring dose and frequency responses in single cells, we characterize the precision, timing, and efficiency with which signals are transmitted from Ras to Erk. Moreover, we elucidate how a single pathway can specify distinct physiological outcomes: by combining distinct temporal patterns of stimulation with proteomic profiling, we identify signaling programs that differentially respond to Ras dynamics, including a paracrine circuit that activates STAT3 only after persistent (\&gt;1~hr) Ras activation. Optogenetic stimulation provides a powerful tool for analyzing the intrinsic transmission properties of pathway modules and identifying how they dynamically encode distinct outcomes.},

Disruption of proteostasis is implicated in aging and the pathogenesis of numerous degenerative diseases. In the cytosol, different classes of molecular chaperones cooperate in evolutionarily conserved folding pathways. Nascent polypeptides interact cotranslationally with a first set of chaperones, including trigger factor and the Hsp70 system, which prevent premature (mis)folding. Folding occurs upon controlled release of newly synthesized proteins from these factors or after transfer to downstream chaperones such as the chaperonins. Chaperonins are large, cylindrical complexes that provide a central compartment for a single protein chain to fold unimpaired by aggregation. This review focuses on recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of chaperone action in promoting and regulating protein folding and on the pathological consequences of protein misfolding and aggregation.},

Dysfunction of protein quality control contributes to~the cellular pathology of polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion diseases and other neurodegenerative disorders associated with aggregate deposition. Here we analyzed how polyQ aggregation interferes with the clearance of misfolded proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). We show in a yeast model that polyQ-expanded proteins inhibit the UPS-mediated degradation of misfolded cytosolic carboxypeptidase Y${_\ast}$ fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) (CG${_\ast}$) without blocking ubiquitylation or proteasome function. Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals that the polyQ aggregates sequester the low-abundant and essential Hsp40 chaperone Sis1p. Overexpression of Sis1p restores CG${_\ast}$ degradation. Surprisingly, we find that Sis1p, and its homolog DnaJB1 in mammalian cells, mediates the delivery of misfolded proteins into the nucleus for proteasomal degradation. Sis1p shuttles between cytosol and nucleus, and its cellular level limits the capacity of this quality control pathway. Upon depletion of Sis1p by polyQ aggregation, misfolded proteins are barred from entering the nucleus and form cytoplasmic inclusions.},

Oculo-Cerebro-Renal syndrome of Lowe (Lowe syndrome) is a rare genetic disorder that can cause cataracts, mental disabilities and kidney dysfunction. It is caused by mutations in the gene encoding OCRL, a protein that modifies a membrane lipid and that is found on membranes transporting molecules (cargo) into cells by a process known as endocytosis.
During endocytosis, the cell outer membrane is deformed into a pit that engulfs the cargo to be taken up by the cell. The pit then pinches off from the outer membrane to form a vesicle\textemdash{}a bubble-like compartment\textemdash{}inside the cell that transports the cargo to its destination. In one type of endocytosis, this process is mediated by a basket-like coat primarily made up from the protein clathrin that assembles at the membrane patch to be internalized. After the vesicle is released from the cell membrane, the clathrin coat is broken apart and its components are shed and recycled for use by new budding endocytic vesicles.
The OCRL protein had previously been observed associated to newly forming clathrin-coated vesicles, but the significance of this was not known. Now, N\'andez et al. have used a range of imaging and analytical techniques to further investigate the properties of OCRL, taking advantage of cells from patients with Lowe syndrome. These cells lack OCRL, and so allow the effect of OCRL's absence on cell function to be deduced. OCRL destroys the membrane lipid that helps to connect the clathrin coat to the membrane, and N\'andez et al. show that without OCRL the newly formed vesicle moves into the cell but fails to efficiently shed its clathrin coat. Thus, a large fraction of clathrin coat components remain trapped on the vesicles, reducing the amount of such components available to help new pits develop into vesicles. As a consequence, the cell has difficulty internalizing molecules.
Collectively, the findings of N\'andez et al. outline that OCRL plays a role in the regulation of endocytosis in addition to its previously reported actions in the control of intracellular membrane traffic. The results also help to explain some of the symptoms seen in Lowe syndrome patients.

  abstract = {Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have recently shown state of the art performance in high level vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection. This work brings together methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models for addressing the task of pixel-level classification (also called "semantic image segmentation"). We show that responses at the final layer of DCNNs are not sufficiently localized for accurate object segmentation. This is due to the very invariance properties that make DCNNs good for high level tasks. We overcome this poor localization property of deep networks by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF). Qualitatively, our "DeepLab" system is able to localize segment boundaries at a level of accuracy which is beyond previous methods. Quantitatively, our method sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 71.6\% IOU accuracy in the test set. We show how these results can be obtained efficiently: Careful network re-purposing and a novel application of the 'hole' algorithm from the wavelet community allow dense computation of neural net responses at 8 frames per second on a modern GPU.},

Here we analyse the sequence features influencing protein expression levels in 6,348 experiments using bacteriophage T7 polymerase to synthesize messenger RNA in Escherichia coli. Logistic regression yields a new codon-influence metric that correlates only weakly with genomic codon-usage frequency, but strongly with global physiological protein concentrations and also mRNA concentrations and lifetimes in vivo. Overall, the codon content influences protein expression more strongly than mRNA-folding parameters, although the latter dominate in the initial \textasciitilde{}16 codons. Genes redesigned based on our analyses are transcribed with unaltered efficiency but translated with higher efficiency in vitro. The less efficiently translated native sequences show greatly reduced mRNA levels in vivo. Our results suggest that codon content modulates a kinetic competition between protein elongation and mRNA degradation that is a central feature of the physiology and also possibly the regulation of translation in E. coli.},

Here we develop Single Molecule Kinetic Analysis of RNA Transient Structure (SiM-KARTS) to investigate the ligand-dependent accessibility of the SD sequence of an mRNA hosting the 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine (preQ1)-sensing riboswitch. Spike train analysis reveals that individual mRNA molecules alternate between two conformational states, distinguished by `bursts' of probe binding associated with increased SD sequence accessibility. Addition of preQ1 decreases the lifetime of the SD's high-accessibility (bursting) state and prolongs the time between bursts. In addition, ligand-jump experiments reveal imperfect riboswitching of single mRNA molecules. Such complex ligand sensing by individual mRNA molecules rationalizes the nuanced ligand response observed during bulk mRNA translation.},

  abstract = {Diffusion in the bacterial cytoplasm is regarded as the primary method of intracellular protein movement and must play a major role in controlling the rates of cell processes. A number of recent studies have used green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagging and fluorescence microscopy to probe the movement and distribution of proteins in the bacterial cytoplasm. However, the dynamic behavior of indigenous proteins must be controlled by a complex mixture of specific interactions, combined with the basic physical constraints imposed by the viscosity and macromolecular crowding of the cytoplasm. These factors are difficult to unravel in studies with indigenous proteins. To what extent the addition of a GFP tag might affect the movement of a protein through the cytoplasm has also remained unknown. To resolve these problems, we have carried out a systematic study of the size dependence of protein diffusion coefficients in the Escherichia coli cytoplasm, using engineered GFP multimers (from 2 to 6 covalently linked GFP molecules). Diffusion coefficients were measured using confocal fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). At least up to 110 kDa (four linked GFP molecules), the diffusion coefficient varies with size roughly as would be predicted from the Einstein-Stokes equation for a classical (Newtonian) fluid. Thus, protein diffusion coefficients are predictable over this range. GFP tagging of proteins has little impact on the diffusion coefficient over this size range and therefore need not significantly perturb protein movement. Two indigenous E. coli proteins were used to show that their specific interactions within the cell are the main controllers of the diffusion rate.},

This approach critically relies on the knowledge of the size-dependence of diffusion. We have used mesoscopic simulations to thoroughly quantify the size-dependent diffusion properties of membrane inclusions. For small radii R, we find that the lateral diffusion coefficient D is well described by the Saffman-Delbr\"uck relation, which predicts a logarithmic decrease of D with R. However, beyond a critical radius Rc $\approx$ h$\eta$m/(2$\eta$c) (h, bilayer thickness; $\eta$m/c, viscosity of the membrane/surrounding solvent) we observe significant deviations and the emergence of an asymptotic scaling D $\sim$ 1/R2. The latter originates from the asymptotic hydrodynamics and the inclusion's internal degrees of freedom that become particularly relevant on short timescales. In contrast to the lateral diffusion, the size dependence of the rotational diffusion constant Dr follows the predicted hydrodynamic scaling Dr $\sim$ 1/R2 over the entire range of sizes studied here.},

The temperature dependence of surface pressure vs. surface area equilibrium isotherms shows a glass-like transition temperature at Tg,2D $\approx$ 298 K, significantly lower than the value for bulk PMMA (Tg,bulk $\approx$ 378 K). The plot of the film thickness h vs. temperature shows a sharp change of slope at about the same temperature, 298 K, which is a typical hallmark of a glass transition in thin polymer films [J. L. Keddie, R. A. L. Jones, R. A. Cory, Europhys. Lett., 1996, 27, 59\textendash{}64]. Furthermore, slightly above Tg,2D, the temperature dependence of the dilational viscosity does not follow an Arrhenius law, but instead can be described by a Vogel\textendash{}Fulcher\textendash{}Tamman equation with parameters that are typical of a fragile glass. Not only the qualitative behavior of three distinct equilibrium and dynamic properties, but also the quantitative agreement of the values of Tg obtained, are a strong evidence of the existence of a fluid to soft-glass transition in this quasi-2D system.},

Competition theory predicts that, at equilibrium, the number of coexisting species cannot exceed the number of limiting resources. For phytoplankton, only a few resources are potentially limiting: nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, iron, light, inorganic carbon, and sometimes a few trace metals or vitamins. However, in natural waters dozens of phytoplankton species coexist. Here we offer a solution to the plankton paradox. First, we show that resource competition models can generate oscillations and chaos when species compete for three or more resources. Second, we show that these oscillations and chaotic fluctuations in species abundances allow the coexistence of many species on a handful of resources. This model of planktonic biodiversity may be broadly applicable to the biodiversity of many ecosystems.},

What is the pathway by which membrane proteins reach their proper subcellular destination in bacteria? We have addressed this question by using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to a polytopic membrane protein (SpoIVFB) that is involved in the process of sporulation in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. SpoIVFB-GFP localizes to a region of the sporulating cell known as the outer forespore membrane, which is distinct from the cytoplasmic membrane. Experiments are presented that rule out a mechanism in which SpoIVFB-GFP localizes to all membranes but is selectively eliminated from the cytoplasmic membrane by proteolytic degradation and argue against a model in which SpoIVFB-GFP is selectively inserted into the outer forespore membrane. Instead, the results are most easily compatible with a model in which SpoIVFB-GFP achieves proper localization by insertion into the cytoplasmic membrane followed by diffusion to, and capture in, the outer forespore membrane. The possibility that diffusion and capture is a general feature of protein localization in bacteria is discussed.},

  abstract = {Analyzing the dynamics of membrane proteins in the context of cellular signaling represents a challenging problem in contemporary cell biology. Lateral diffusion of lipids and proteins in the cell membrane is known to be influenced by the cytoskeleton. In this work, we explored the role of the actin cytoskeleton on the mobility of the serotonin1A (5-HT1A) receptor, stably expressed in CHO cells, and its implications in signaling. FRAP analysis of 5-HT1AR-EYFP shows that destabilization of the actin cytoskeleton induced by either CD or elevation of cAMP levels mediated by forskolin results in an increase in the mobile fraction of the receptor. The increase in the mobile fraction is accompanied by a corresponding increase in the signaling efficiency of the receptor. Interestingly, with increasing concentrations of CD used, the increase in the mobile fraction exhibited a correlation of $\sim$0.95 with the efficiency in ligand-mediated signaling of the receptor. Radioligand binding and G-protein coupling of the receptor were found to be unaffected upon treatment with CD. Our results suggest that signaling by the serotonin1A receptor is correlated with receptor mobility, implying thereby that the actin cytoskeleton could play a regulatory role in receptor signaling. These results may have potential significance in the context of signaling by GPCRs in general and in the understanding of GPCR-cytoskeleton interactions with respect to receptor signaling in particular.},

Biological membranes segregate into specialized functional domains of distinct composition, which can persist for the entire life of the cell. How separation of their lipid and (glyco)protein components is generated and maintained is not well understood, but the existence of diffusional barriers has been proposed. Remarkably, the physical nature of such barriers and the manner whereby they impede the free diffusion of molecules in the plane of the membrane has rarely been studied in depth. Moreover, alternative mechanisms capable of generating membrane inhomogeneity are often disregarded. Here we describe prototypical biological systems where membrane segregation has been amply documented and discuss the role of diffusional barriers and other processes in the generation and maintenance of their structural and functional compartmentalization.},

While cyclic /‘rock-paper-scissors/' interactions can stabilize communities in spatial environments, coexistence in unstructured environments remains unexplained. Here, using simulations and analytical models, we show that the opposing actions of antibiotic production and degradation enable coexistence even in well-mixed environments. Coexistence depends on three-way interactions in which an antibiotic-degrading species attenuates the inhibitory interactions between two other species. These interactions enable coexistence that is robust to substantial differences in inherent species growth rates and to invasion by /‘cheating/' species that cease to produce or degrade antibiotics. At least two antibiotics are required for stability, with greater numbers of antibiotics enabling more complex communities and diverse dynamic behaviours ranging from stable fixed points to limit cycles and chaos. Together, these results show how multi-species antibiotic interactions can generate ecological stability in both spatially structured and mixed microbial communities, suggesting strategies for engineering synthetic ecosystems and highlighting the importance of toxin production and degradation for microbial biodiversity.},

We found that the plasma membrane proteins form multi-protein assemblies that are long lived (minutes), and in which protein diffusion is restricted. The formation of the assemblies is dependent on \mbox{}cholesterol. They are separated and anchored by the actin cytoskeleton. Specific proteins are preferentially located in different regions of the assemblies, from their cores to their edges.

We show that the dynamic behaviour of such a two-prey, one-predator system includes chaotic behaviour, as well as stable limit cycles and coexistence at equilibrium. Changes in the population dynamics were triggered by changes in the dilution rates of the chemostat. The observed dynamics were verified by estimating the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. Such a defined microbial food web offers a new possibility for the experimental study of deterministic chaos in real biological systems.},

However, it is unknown whether SNAREs are uniformly distributed in the membrane or whether specialized fusion sites exist. Here we report that in the plasmalemma, syntaxins are concentrated in 200~nm large, cholesterol-dependent clusters at which secretory vesicles preferentially dock and fuse. The syntaxin clusters are distinct from cholesterol-dependent membrane rafts since they are Triton X-100-soluble and do not co-patch with raft markers. Synaptosomal-associated protein (SNAP)-25 is also clustered in spots, which partially overlap with syntaxin. Cholesterol depletion causes dispersion of these clusters, which is associated with a strong reduction in the rate of secretion, whereas the characteristics of individual exocytic events are unchanged. This suggests that high local concentrations of SNAREs are required for efficient fusion.},

Receptor movement in the plane of the plasma membrane by thermally powered Brownian diffusion movement and reversible trapping by receptor-scaffold interactions has emerged as the main mechanism to dynamically organize the synaptic membrane in nanoscale domains. We will discuss here the different conceptual and methodological advances that have led to a rethinking of the synapse as an organelle whose function is tightly linked to its dynamic organization.},

Membrane rafts of higher lipid chain order were proposed to mediate protein interactions, but have thus far not been directly observed. Here we use protein micropatterning combined with single-molecule tracking to put current models to the test: we rearranged lipid-anchored raft proteins (glycosylphosphatidylinositol(GPI)-anchored-mGFP) directly in the live cell plasma membrane and measured the effect on the local membrane environment. Intriguingly, this treatment does neither nucleate the formation of an ordered membrane phase nor result in any enrichment of nanoscopic-ordered domains within the micropatterned regions. In contrast, we find that immobilized mGFP-GPIs behave as inert obstacles to the diffusion of other membrane constituents without influencing their membrane environment over distances beyond their physical size. Our results indicate that phase partitioning is not a fundamental element of protein organization in the plasma membrane.},

At the genomic scale, we measured the contribution of both transcription and transcript stability to regulating messenger RNA (mRNA) concentration in Escherichia coli. Transcriptional control was the dominant regulatory process. Between growth rates of 0.10 and 0.63 h-1, there was a generic increase in the bulk mRNA transcription. However, many transcripts became less stable and the median mRNA half-life decreased from 4.2 to 2.8 min. This is the first evidence that mRNA turnover is slower at extremely low-growth rates. The destabilization of many, but not all, transcripts at high-growth rate correlated with transcriptional upregulation of genes encoding the mRNA degradation machinery. We identified five classes of growth-rate regulation ranging from mainly transcriptional to mainly degradational. In general, differential stability within polycistronic messages encoded by operons does not appear to be affected by growth rate. We show here that the substantial reorganization of gene expression involving downregulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle genes and acetyl-CoA synthetase at high-growth rates is controlled mainly by transcript stability. Overall, our results demonstrate that the control of transcript stability has an important role in fine-tuning mRNA concentration during changes in growth rate.},

Here we show that excluded volume effects generated by DNA-bound proteins can generate substantial quenching. Moreover, the type and extent of the regulatory effect depend strongly on the relative arrangement of the binding sites. The implications of these results are that enhancers should be insensitive to 10\textendash{}11 bp insertions or deletions (INDELs) and sensitive to 5\textendash{}6 bp INDELs.

The hydrodynamic radii (3?24 nm) of the nine antibody types were determined by comparing literature values with bulk diffusion coefficients measured by spot FCS. The diffusion coefficients very near membranes decreased significantly with molecular size, and the size dependence was greater than that predicted to occur in bulk solution. The observation that membrane surfaces slow the local diffusion coefficient of proteins in a size-dependent manner suggests that the primary effect is hydrodynamic as predicted for simple spheres diffusing close to planar walls. The TIR-FCS data are consistent with predictions derived from hydrodynamic theory.

  abstract = {This review aims at presenting state-of-the-art knowledge on the composition and functions of the endothelial glycocalyx. The endothelial glycocalyx is a network of membrane-bound proteoglycans and glycoproteins, covering the endothelium luminally. Both endothelium- and plasma-derived soluble molecules integrate into this mesh. Over the past decade, insight has been gained into the role of the glycocalyx in vascular physiology and pathology, including mechanotransduction, hemostasis, signaling, and blood cell\textendash{}vessel wall interactions. The contribution of the glycocalyx to diabetes, ischemia/reperfusion, and atherosclerosis is also reviewed. Experimental data from the micro- and macrocirculation alludes at a vasculoprotective role for the glycocalyx. Assessing this possible role of the endothelial glycocalyx requires reliable visualization of this delicate layer, which is a great challenge. An overview is given of the various ways in which the endothelial glycocalyx has been visualized up to now, including first data from two-photon microscopic imaging.},

Communities of soil microorganisms perform critical functions: controlling climate, enhancing crop production, and remediation of environmental contamination. Microbial communities in the oral cavity and the gut are of high biomedical interest. Understanding and harnessing the function of these communities is difficult: artificial microbial communities in the laboratory become unstable because of ``winner-takes-all'' competition among species. We constructed a community of three different species of wild-type soil bacteria with syntrophic interactions using a microfluidic device to control spatial structure and chemical communication. We found that defined microscale spatial structure is both necessary and sufficient for the stable coexistence of interacting bacterial species in the synthetic community. A mathematical model describes how spatial structure can balance the competition and positive interactions within the community, even when the rates of production and consumption of nutrients by species are mismatched, by exploiting nonlinearities of these processes. These findings provide experimental and modeling evidence for a class of communities that require microscale spatial structure for stability, and these results predict that controlling spatial structure may enable harnessing the function of natural and synthetic multispecies communities in the laboratory.},

  abstract = {Forty years ago, May proved that sufficiently large or complex ecological networks have a probability of persisting that is close to zero, contrary to previous expectations. May analysed large networks in which species interact at random. However, in natural systems pairs of species have well-defined interactions (for example predator-prey, mutualistic or competitive). Here we extend May/'s results to these relationships and find remarkable differences between predator-prey interactions, which are stabilizing, and mutualistic and competitive interactions, which are destabilizing. We provide analytic stability criteria for all cases. We use the criteria to prove that, counterintuitively, the probability of stability for predator-prey networks decreases when a realistic food web structure is imposed or if there is a large preponderance of weak interactions. Similarly, stability is negatively affected by nestedness in bipartite mutualistic networks. These results are found by separating the contribution of network structure and interaction strengths to stability. Stable predator-prey networks can be arbitrarily large and complex, provided that predator-prey pairs are tightly coupled. The stability criteria are widely applicable, because they hold for any system of differential equations.},

Earlier studies often assumed a community with only one interaction type, either an antagonistic, competitive, or mutualistic interaction, leaving open the question of what the diversity of interaction types contributes to the community maintenance. We show theoretically that the multiple interaction types might hold the key to understanding community dynamics. A moderate mixture of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions can stabilize population dynamics. Furthermore, increasing complexity leads to increased stability in a ``hybrid'' community. We hypothesize that the diversity of species and interaction types may be the essential element of biodiversity that maintains ecological communities.

We tracked the membrane diffusion of AQP1 molecules labeled with quantum dots at an engineered external epitope at frame rates up to 91 Hz and over times up to 6 min. In transfected COS-7 cells, \&gt;75\% of AQP1 molecules diffused freely over $\sim$7 $\mu$m in 5 min, with diffusion coefficient, D1-3 $\sim$ 9 \texttimes{} 10-10 cm2/s. In MDCK cells, $\sim$60\% of AQP1 diffused freely, with D1-3 $\sim$ 3 \texttimes{} 10-10 cm2/s. The determinants of AQP1 diffusion were investigated by measurements of AQP1 diffusion following skeletal disruption (latrunculin B), lipid/raft perturbations (cyclodextrin and sphingomyelinase), and bleb formation. We found that cytoskeletal disruption had no effect on AQP1 diffusion in the plasma membrane, but that diffusion was increased greater than fourfold in protein de-enriched blebs. Cholesterol depletion in MDCK cells greatly restricted AQP1 diffusion, consistent with the formation of a network of solid-like barriers in the membrane. These results establish the nature and determinants of AQP1 diffusion in cell plasma membranes and demonstrate long-range nonanomalous diffusion of AQP1, challenging the prevailing view of universally anomalous diffusion of integral membrane proteins, and providing evidence against the accumulation of AQP1 in lipid rafts.},

Interestingly, RingoA is required for Cdk2 targeting to telomeres and RingoA KO spermatocytes display severely affected telomere tethering as well as impaired distribution of Sun1, a protein essential for the attachment of telomeres to the nuclear envelope. Our results identify RingoA as an important activator of Cdk2 at meiotic telomeres, and provide genetic evidence for a physiological function of mammalian Cdk2 that is not dependent on cyclins.},

  abstract = {Summary
The rate of lateral diffusion of proteins over micron-scale distances in the plasma membrane (PM) of mammalian cells is much slower than in artificial membranes [1, 2]. Different models have been advanced to account for this discrepancy. They invoke either effects on the apparent viscosity of cell membranes through, for example, protein crowding [3, 4], or~a role for cortical factors such as actin or spectrin filaments [1]. Here, we use photobleaching to test specific predictions of these models [5]. Neither loss of detectable cortical actin nor knockdown of spectrin expression has any effect on diffusion. Disruption of the PM by formation of ventral membrane sheets or permeabilization induces aggregation of membrane proteins, with a concomitant increase in rates of diffusion for the nonaggregated fraction. In addition, procedures that directly increase or decrease the total protein content of the PM in live cells cause reciprocal changes in~lateral diffusion rates. Our data imply that slow diffusion over micron-scale distances is an intrinsic property of the membrane itself and that the density of proteins within the membrane is a significant parameter in determining rates of lateral diffusion.},

  abstract = {Protein diffusion in lipid membranes is a key aspect of many cellular signaling processes. To quantitatively describe protein diffusion in membranes, several competing theoretical models have been proposed. Among these, the Saffman-Delbr\"uck model is the most famous. This model predicts a logarithmic dependence of a protein's diffusion coefficient on its inverse hydrodynamic radius (D $\propto$ ln 1/R) for small radius values. For large radius values, it converges toward a D $\propto$ 1/R scaling. Recently, however, experimental data indicate a Stokes-Einstein-like behavior (D $\propto$ 1/R) of membrane protein diffusion at small protein radii. In this study, we investigate protein diffusion in black lipid membranes using dual-focus fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. This technique yields highly accurate diffusion coefficients for lipid and protein diffusion in membranes. We find that despite its simplicity, the Saffman-Delbr\"uck model is able to describe protein diffusion extremely well and a Stokes-Einstein-like behavior can be ruled out.},

We have now measured the extent of energy transfer between isoforms of the folate receptor bound to a fluorescent analogue of folic acid, in terms of the dependence of fluorescence polarization on fluorophore densities in membranes. We find that the extent of energy transfer for the GPI-anchored folate-receptor isoform is density-independent, which is characteristic of organization in sub-pixel-sized domains at the surface of living cells; however, the extent of energy transfer for the transmembrane-anchored folate-receptor isoform was density-dependent, which is consistent with a random distribution. These domains are likely to be less than 70 nm in diameter and are disrupted by removal of cellular cholesterol. These results indicate that lipid-linked proteins are organized in cholesterol-dependent submicron-sized domains.

  abstract = {Molecular diffusion at the surface of living cells is believed to be predominantly driven by thermal kicks. However, there is growing evidence that certain cell surface molecules are driven by the fluctuating dynamics of cortical cytoskeleton. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we measure the diffusion coefficient of a variety of cell surface molecules over a temperature range of 24\textendash{}37$^\circ$C. Exogenously incorporated fluorescent lipids with short acyl chains exhibit the expected increase of diffusion coefficient over this temperature range. In contrast, we find that GPI-anchored proteins exhibit temperature-independent diffusion over this range and revert to temperature-dependent diffusion on cell membrane blebs, in cells depleted of cholesterol, and upon acute perturbation of actin dynamics and myosin activity. A model transmembrane protein with a cytosolic actin-binding domain also exhibits the temperature-independent behavior, directly implicating the role of cortical actin. We show that diffusion of GPI-anchored proteins also becomes temperature dependent when the filamentous dynamic actin nucleator formin is inhibited. However, changes in cortical actin mesh size or perturbation of branched actin nucleator Arp2/3 do not affect this behavior. Thus cell surface diffusion of GPI-anchored proteins and transmembrane proteins that associate with actin is driven by active fluctuations of dynamic cortical actin filaments in addition to thermal fluctuations, consistent with expectations from an ``active actin-membrane composite'' cell surface.},

This slowing mechanism has puzzled cell biologists for the last 25 yr. Here we address this issue by studying the movement of unsaturated phospholipids in rat kidney fibroblasts at the single molecule level at the temporal resolution of 25 $\mu$s. The cell membrane was found to be compartmentalized: phospholipids are confined within 230-nm-diameter ($\phi$) compartments for 11 ms on average before hopping to adjacent compartments. These 230-nm compartments exist within greater 750-nm-$\phi$ compartments where these phospholipids are confined for 0.33 s on average. The diffusion rate within 230-nm compartments is 5.4 $\mu$m2/s, which is nearly as fast as that in large unilamellar vesicles, indicating that the diffusion in the cell membrane is reduced not because diffusion per se is slow, but because the cell membrane is compartmentalized with regard to lateral diffusion of phospholipids. Such compartmentalization depends on the actin-based membrane skeleton, but not on the extracellular matrix, extracellular domains of membrane proteins, or cholesterol-enriched rafts. We propose that various transmembrane proteins anchored to the actin-based membrane skeleton meshwork act as rows of pickets that temporarily confine phospholipids.},

We further establish that cell cycle events neither participate in nor interfere with the Cdk1-driven transcriptional program, provided that cells are exposed to the appropriate Cdk1 activities. These findings contrast with current models that propose self-sustained and Cdk1-independent transcriptional oscillations.

We address reconstruction and segmentation performance on samples with different size, anatomy and complexity. Finally, in vivo real-time high dynamic range imaging is also demonstrated, making the technique particularly relevant for longitudinal imaging in the presence of physiological motion and/or for quantification of in vivo fast tracer kinetics during functional imaging.},

We now present data on the effect of hydrocarbon chain length of the lipids and headgroup composition on the lateral mobility of the proteins in model membranes. The trimeric glutamate transporter (GltT) and the monomeric lactose transporter (LacY) were reconstituted in giant unilamellar vesicles composed of unsaturated phosphocholine lipids of varying acyl chain length (14\textendash{}22 carbon atoms) and various ratios of DOPE/DOPG/DOPC lipids. The lateral mobility of the proteins and of a fluorescent lipid analog was determined as a function of the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer (h) and lipid composition, using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The diffusion coefficient of LacY decreased with increasing thickness of the bilayer, in accordance with the continuum hydrodynamic model of Saffman-Delbr\"uck. For GltT, the mobility had its maximum at diC18:1 PC, which is close to the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer in~vivo. The lateral mobility decreased linearly with the concentration of DOPE but was not affected by the fraction of anionic lipids from DOPG. The addition of DOPG and DOPE did not affect the activity of GltT. We conclude that the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer is a major determinant of molecule diffusion in membranes, but protein-specific properties may lead to deviations from the Saffman-Delbr\"uck model.},

Lipid droplets (LDs) are lipid storage organelles that grow or shrink, depending on the availability of metabolic energy. Proteins recruited to LDs mediate many metabolic functions, including phosphatidylcholine~and triglyceride synthesis. How the LD protein composition is tuned to the supply and demand for lipids remains unclear. We show that LDs, in contrast to other organelles, have limited capacity for protein binding. Consequently, macromolecular crowding plays a major role in determining LD protein composition. During lipolysis, when LDs and their surfaces shrink, some, but not all, proteins become displaced. In~vitro studies show that macromolecular crowding, rather than changes in monolayer lipid composition, causes proteins to fall off the LD surface. As predicted by a crowding model, proteins compete for binding to the surfaces of LDs. Moreover, the LD binding affinity determines protein localization during lipolysis. Our findings identify protein crowding as an important principle in determining LD protein composition.},

  abstract = {The membrane raft hypothesis postulates the existence of lipid bilayer membrane heterogeneities, or domains, supposed to be important for cellular function, including lateral sorting, signaling, and trafficking. Characterization of membrane lipid heterogeneities in live cells has been challenging in part because inhomogeneity has not usually been definable by optical microscopy. Model membrane systems, including giant unilamellar vesicles, allow optical fluorescence discrimination of coexisting lipid phase types, but thus far have focused on coexisting optically resolvable fluid phases in simple lipid mixtures. Here we demonstrate that giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) or blebs formed from the plasma membranes of cultured mammalian cells can also segregate into micrometer-scale fluid phase domains. Phase segregation temperatures are widely spread, with the vast majority of GPMVs found to form optically resolvable domains only at temperatures below $\approx$25$^\circ$C. At 37$^\circ$C, these GPMV membranes are almost exclusively optically homogenous. At room temperature, we find diagnostic lipid phase fluorophore partitioning preferences in GPMVs analogous to the partitioning behavior now established in model membrane systems with liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered fluid phase coexistence. We image these GPMVs for direct visual characterization of protein partitioning between coexisting liquid-ordered-like and liquid-disordered-like membrane phases in the absence of detergent perturbation. For example, we find that the transmembrane IgE receptor Fc$\epsilon$RI preferentially segregates into liquid-disordered-like phases, and we report the partitioning of additional well known membrane associated proteins. Thus, GPMVs now provide an effective approach to characterize biological membrane heterogeneities.},

  abstract = {Multivalent glycolipid binding toxins such as cholera toxin have the capacity to cluster glycolipids, a process thought to be important for their functional uptake into cells. In contrast to the highly dynamic properties of lipid probes and many lipid-anchored proteins, the B-subunit of cholera toxin (CTxB) diffuses extremely slowly when bound to its glycolipid receptor GM1 in the plasma membrane of living cells. In the current study, we used confocal FRAP to examine the origins of this slow diffusion of the CTxB/GM1 complex at the cell surface, relative to the behavior of a representative GPI-anchored protein, transmembrane protein, and fluorescent lipid analog. We show that the diffusion of CTxB is impeded by actin- and ATP-dependent processes, but is unaffected by caveolae. At physiological temperature, the diffusion of several cell surface markers is unchanged in the presence of CTxB, suggesting that binding of CTxB to membranes does not alter the organization of the plasma membrane in a way that influences the diffusion of other molecules. Furthermore, diffusion of the B-subunit of another glycolipid-binding toxin, Shiga toxin, is significantly faster than that of CTxB, indicating that the confined diffusion of CTxB is not a simple function of its ability to cluster glycolipids. By identifying underlying mechanisms that control CTxB dynamics at the cell surface, these findings help to delineate the fundamental properties of toxin-receptor complexes in intact cell membranes.},

Talk Overview: 
Most bacterial cells are many, many times smaller than eukaryotic cells.  Since they have no membrane-bound internal organelles, their cellular organization also appears much simpler.  Over the last decade, however, scientists have come to understand that that bacterial cells have a cytoskeleton. Jacobs-Wagner explains that bacterial homologues of tubulin (FtsZ) and actin (MreB) are critical for cell division amongst other functions.  Crescentin, a bacterial counterpart of intermediate filament proteins, gives Caulobacter crescentus its crescent shape.  In addition, bacteria exhibit sophisticated spatial organization; proteins can be spatially patterned and the bacterial chromosome forms an organized structure that locates genes at specific positions in the cell. 

In her second lecture, Jacobs-Wagner tells us about research in her lab into how bacterial chromosomal DNA is segregated.  For distances as small as those found in a bacterial cell, diffusion can successfully distribute high copy number molecules throughout the cell.  However, diffusion cannot effectively separate 2 chromosomes such that after cell division each daughter cell is likely to have one chromosome.  To do this job, bacteria have evolved a partitioning system called ParABS.  Jacobs-Wagner describes the how the ParABS system works to separate chromosomal DNA in C. crescentus. 

Speaker Biography:
Christine Jacobs-Wagner received her BS in biochemistry from the University of Li\`ege in Belgium and her PhD from the University of Li\`ege and the Karolinska Institute.  As a post-doctoral fellow she worked with Lucy Shapiro at Stanford University. In 2001, Jacobs-Wagner moved to Yale University where she is currently a Professor of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology and Director of the Microbial Sciences Institute. Jacobs-Wagner also has been a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator since 2008. Her lab investigates the spatial and temporal organization of molecules inside bacteria and the impact of this organization on bacterial function and behavior.

Jacobs-Wagner's pioneering research has been recognized with a Pew Scholar Award, the American Society for Cell Biology Women in Cell Biology Junior Award, and the Eli Lilly Award from the American Society of Microbiology.},

Observation of anomalous diffusion in vivo and in vitro using fluorescence microscopy and single particle tracking has advanced our concept of the membrane from a homogeneous fluid bilayer with freely diffusing proteins to a highly organized crowded and clustered mosaic of lipids and proteins. Unfortunately, anomalous diffusion could not be related to local molecular details given the lack of direct and unlabeled molecular observation capabilities. Here, we use high-speed atomic force microscopy and a novel analysis methodology to analyze the pore forming protein lysenin in a highly crowded environment and document coexistence of several diffusion regimes within one membrane. We show the formation of local glassy phases, where proteins are trapped in neighbor-formed cages for time scales up to 10 s, which had not been previously experimentally reported for biological membranes. Furthermore, around solid-like patches and immobile molecules a slower glass phase is detected leading to protein trapping and creating a perimeter of decreased membrane diffusion.},

  abstract = {Molecules undergo non-Brownian diffusion in the plasma membrane, but the mechanism behind this anomalous diffusion is controversial. To characterize the anomalous diffusion in the complex system of the plasma membrane and to understand its underlying mechanism, single-molecule/particle methods that allow researchers to avoid ensemble averaging have turned out to be highly effective. However, the intrinsic problems of time-averaging (resolution) and the frequency of the observations have not been explored. These would not matter for the observations of simple Brownian particles, but they do strongly affect the observation of molecules undergoing anomalous diffusion. We examined these effects on the apparent motion of molecules undergoing simple, totally confined, or hop diffusion, using Monte Carlo simulations of particles undergoing short-term confined diffusion within a compartment and long-term hop diffusion between these compartments, explicitly including the effects of time-averaging during a single frame of the camera (exposure time) and the frequency of observations (frame rate). The intricate relationships of these time-related experimental parameters with the intrinsic diffusion parameters have been clarified, which indicated that by systematically varying the frame time and rate, the anomalous diffusion can be clearly detected and characterized. Based on these results, single-particle tracking of transferrin receptor in the plasma membrane of live PtK2 cells were carried out, varying the frame time between 0.025 and 33 ms (0.03\textendash{}40 kHz), which revealed the hop diffusion of the receptor between 47-nm (average) compartments with an average residency time of 1.7 ms, with the aid of single fluorescent-molecule video imaging.},

Although these traits are often studied independently, it is their combination that generates the unique interfacial properties of cellular membranes. Here, we use a combination of in vivo, in vitro and in silico approaches to provide a comprehensive map of how these parameters modulate membrane adhesive properties. The correlation between the membrane partitioning of model amphipathic helices and the distribution of lipid-packing defects in membranes of different shape and composition explains how macroscopic membrane properties modulate protein recruitment by changing the molecular topography of the membrane interfacial region. Furthermore, our results suggest that the range of conditions that can be obtained in a cellular context is remarkably large because lipid composition and curvature have, under most circumstances, cumulative effects.},

  abstract = {A fluid mosaic model is presented for the gross organization and structure of the proteins and lipids of biological membranes. The model is consistent with the restrictions imposed by thermodynamics. In this model, the proteins that are integral to the membrane are a heterogeneous set of globular molecules, each arranged in an amphipathic structure, that is, with the ionic and highly polar groups protruding from the membrane into the aqueous phase, and the nonpolar groups largely buried in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. These globular molecules are partially embedded in a matrix of phospholipid. The bulk of the phospholipid is organized as a discontinuous, fluid bilayer, although a small fraction of the lipid may interact specifically with the membrane proteins. The fluid mosaic structure is therefore formally analogous to a two-dimensional oriented solution of integral proteins (or lipoproteins) in the viscous phospholipid bilayer solvent. Recent experiments with a wide variety of techniqes and several different membrane systems are described, all of which abet consistent with, and add much detail to, the fluid mosaic model. It therefore seems appropriate to suggest possible mechanisms for various membrane functions and membrane-mediated phenomena in the light of the model. As examples, experimentally testable mechanisms are suggested for cell surface changes in malignant transformation, and for cooperative effects exhibited in the interactions of membranes with some specific ligands.
Note added in proof: Since this article was written, we have obtained electron microscopic evidence (69) that the concanavalin A binding sites on the membranes of SV40 virus-transformed mouse fibroblasts (3T3 cells) are more clustered than the sites on the membranes of normal cells, as predicted by the hypothesis represented in Fig. 7B. T-here has also appeared a study by Taylor et al. (70) showing the remarkable effects produced on lymphocytes by the addition of antibodies directed to their surface immunoglobulin molecules. The antibodies induce a redistribution and pinocytosis of these surface immunoglobulins, so that within about 30 minutes at 37$^\circ$C the surface immunoglobulins are completely swept out of the membrane. These effects do not occur, however, if the bivalent antibodies are replaced by their univalent Fab fragments or if the antibody experiments are carried out at 0$^\circ$C instead of 37$^\circ$C. These and related results strongly indicate that the bivalent antibodies produce an aggregation of the surface immunoglobulin molecules in the plane of the membrane, which can occur only if the immunoglobulin molecules are free to diffuse in the membrane. This aggregation then appears to trigger off the pinocytosis of the membrane components by some unknown mechanism. Such membrane transformations may be of crucial importance in the induction of an antibody response to an antigen, as well as iv other processes of cell differentiation.},

  abstract = {Many biologically important macromolecular reactions are assembled and catalyzed at the cell lipid-surface and thus, the extracellular matrix and the glycocalyx layer mediate transfer and exchange of reactants and products between the flowing blood and the catalytic lipid-surface. This paper presents a mathematical model of reaction-diffusion equations that simply describes the transfer process and explores its influence on surface reactivity for a prototypical pathway, the tissue factor (Tf) pathway of blood coagulation. The progressively increasing friction offered by the matrix and glycocalyx to reactants and to the product (coagulation factors X, VIIa and Xa) approaching the reactive surface is simulated and tested by solving the equations numerically with both, monotonically decreasing and constant diffusion profiles. Numerical results show that compared to isotropic transfer media, the anisotropic structure of the matrix and glycocalyx sharply decreases overall reaction rates and significantly increases the mean transit time of reactants; this implies that the anisotropy modifies the distribution of reactants. Results also show that the diffusional transfer, whether isotropic or anisotropic, influences reaction rates according to the order at which the reactants arrive at the boundary. Faster rates are observed when at least one of the reactants is homogeneously distributed before the other arrives at the boundary than when both reactants transfer simultaneously from the boundary.},

  abstract = {The sequential formation of somites along the anterior-posterior axis is under control of multiple signaling gradients involving the Wnt, FGF, and retinoic acid (RA) pathways. These pathways show graded distribution of signaling activity within the paraxial mesoderm of vertebrate embryos. Although Wnt and FGF signaling show highest activity in the posterior, unsegmented paraxial mesoderm (presomitic mesoderm [PSM]), RA signaling establishes a countergradient with the highest activity in the somites. The generation of these graded activities relies both on classical source-sink mechanisms (for RA signaling) and on an RNA decay mechanism (for FGF signaling). Numerous studies reveal the tight interconnection among Wnt, FGF, and RA signaling in controlling paraxial mesoderm differentiation and in defining the somite-forming unit. In particular, the relationship to a molecular oscillator acting in somite precursors in the PSM\textemdash{}called the segmentation clock\textemdash{}has been recently addressed. These studies indicate that high levels of Wnt and FGF signaling are required for the segmentation clock activity. Furthermore, we discuss how these signaling gradients act in a dose-dependent manner in the progenitors of the paraxial mesoderm, partly by regulating cell movements during gastrulation. Finally, links between the process of axial specification of vertebral segments and Hox gene expression are discussed., A molecular ``segmentation clock'' ensures somites (precursors of vertebrae) form sequentially in embryos. FGF and Wnt signals control this clock's activity.},

  abstract = {We have studied the diffusion of tracer proteins in highly concentrated random-coil polymer and globular protein solutions imitating the crowded conditions encountered in cellular environments. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we measured the anomalous diffusion exponent $\alpha$ characterizing the dependence of the mean-square displacement of the tracer proteins on time, $\langle$r2(t)$\rangle$ $\sim$ t$\alpha$. We observed that the diffusion of proteins in dextran solutions with concentrations up to 400 g/l is subdiffusive ($\alpha$ \&lt; 1) even at low obstacle concentration. The anomalous diffusion exponent $\alpha$ decreases continuously with increasing obstacle concentration and molecular weight, but does not depend on buffer ionic strength, and neither does it depend strongly on solution temperature. At very high random-coil polymer concentrations, $\alpha$ reaches a limit value of $\alpha$l $\approx$ 3/4, which we take to be the signature of a coupling between the motions of the tracer proteins and the segments of the dextran chains. A similar, although less pronounced, subdiffusive behavior is observed for the diffusion of streptavidin in concentrated globular protein solutions. These observations indicate that protein diffusion in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus should be anomalous as well, with consequences for measurements of solute diffusion coefficients in cells and for the modeling of cellular processes relying on diffusion.},

Motivated by recent experiments we report results of extensive simulations of the motion of a finite sized tracer particle in a heterogeneously crowded environment made up of quenched distributions of monodisperse crowders of varying sizes in finite circular two-dimensional domains. For given spatial distributions of monodisperse crowders we demonstrate how anomalous diffusion with strongly non-Gaussian features arises in this model system. We investigate both biologically relevant situations of particles released either at the surface of an inner domain or at the outer boundary, exhibiting distinctly different features of the observed anomalous diffusion for heterogeneous distributions of crowders. Specifically we reveal an asymmetric spreading of tracers even at moderate crowding. In addition to the mean squared displacement (MSD) and local diffusion exponent we investigate the magnitude and the amplitude scatter of the time averaged MSD of individual tracer trajectories, the non-Gaussianity parameter, and the van Hove correlation function. We also quantify how the average tracer diffusivity varies with the position in the domain with a heterogeneous radial distribution of crowders and examine the behaviour of the survival probability and the dynamics of the tracer survival probability. Inter alia, the systems we investigate are related to the passive transport of lipid molecules and proteins in two-dimensional crowded membranes or the motion in colloidal solutions or emulsions in effectively two-dimensional geometries, as well as inside supercrowded, surface adhered cells.},

  abstract = {Molecules undergo non-Brownian diffusion in the plasma membrane, but the mechanism behind this anomalous diffusion is controversial. To characterize the anomalous diffusion in the complex system of the plasma membrane and to understand its underlying mechanism, single-molecule/particle methods that allow researchers to avoid ensemble averaging have turned out to be highly effective. However, the intrinsic problems of time-averaging (resolution) and the frequency of the observations have not been explored. These would not matter for the observations of simple Brownian particles, but they do strongly affect the observation of molecules undergoing anomalous diffusion. We examined these effects on the apparent motion of molecules undergoing simple, totally confined, or hop diffusion, using Monte Carlo simulations of particles undergoing short-term confined diffusion within a compartment and long-term hop diffusion between these compartments, explicitly including the effects of time-averaging during a single frame of the camera (exposure time) and the frequency of observations (frame rate). The intricate relationships of these time-related experimental parameters with the intrinsic diffusion parameters have been clarified, which indicated that by systematically varying the frame time and rate, the anomalous diffusion can be clearly detected and characterized. Based on these results, single-particle tracking of transferrin receptor in the plasma membrane of live PtK2 cells were carried out, varying the frame time between 0.025 and 33 ms (0.03\textendash{}40 kHz), which revealed the hop diffusion of the receptor between 47-nm (average) compartments with an average residency time of 1.7 ms, with the aid of single fluorescent-molecule video imaging.},

What is the pathway by which membrane proteins reach their proper subcellular destination in bacteria? We have addressed this question by using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to a polytopic membrane protein (SpoIVFB) that is involved in the process of sporulation in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. SpoIVFB-GFP localizes to a region of the sporulating cell known as the outer forespore membrane, which is distinct from the cytoplasmic membrane. Experiments are presented that rule out a mechanism in which SpoIVFB-GFP localizes to all membranes but is selectively eliminated from the cytoplasmic membrane by proteolytic degradation and argue against a model in which SpoIVFB-GFP is selectively inserted into the outer forespore membrane. Instead, the results are most easily compatible with a model in which SpoIVFB-GFP achieves proper localization by insertion into the cytoplasmic membrane followed by diffusion to, and capture in, the outer forespore membrane. The possibility that diffusion and capture is a general feature of protein localization in bacteria is discussed.},

  abstract = {Lateral diffusion of proteins in the plane of a biological membrane is important for many vital processes, including energy conversion, signaling, chemotaxis, cell division, protein insertion, and secretion. In bacteria, all these functions are located in a single membrane. Therefore, quantitative measurements of protein diffusion in bacterial membranes can provide insight into many important processes. Diffusion of membrane proteins in eukaryotes has been studied in detail using various experimental techniques, including fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), and particle tracking using single-molecule fluorescence (SMF) microscopy. In case of bacteria, such experiments are intrinsically difficult due to the small size of the cells. Here, we review these experimental approaches to quantify diffusion in general and their strengths and weaknesses when applied to bacteria. In addition, we propose a method to extract multiple diffusion coefficients from trajectories obtained from SMF data, using cumulative probability distributions (CPDs). We demonstrate the power of this approach by quantifying the heterogeneous diffusion of the bacterial membrane protein TatA, which forms a pore for the translocation of folded proteins. Using computer simulations, we study the effect of cell dimensions and membrane curvature on measured CPDs. We find that at least two mobile populations with distinct diffusion coefficients (of 7 and 169 nm2 ms-1, respectively) are necessary to explain the experimental data. The approach described here should be widely applicable for the quantification of membrane-protein diffusion in living bacteria. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Mutual interactions and specific localization of these proteins depend on two-dimensional diffusion driven by thermal fluctuations. The experimental investigation of membrane\textendash{}protein diffusion in bacteria is challenging due to their small size, only a few times larger than the resolution of an optical microscope. Here, we review fluorescence microscopy-based methods to study diffusion of membrane proteins in living bacteria. The main focus is on data-analysis tools to extract diffusion coefficients from single-particle tracking data obtained by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. We introduce a novel approach, IPODD (inverse projection of displacement distributions), to obtain diffusion coefficients from the usually obtained 2-D projected diffusion trajectories of the highly 3-D curved bacterial membrane. This method provides, in contrast to traditional mean-squared-displacement methods, correct diffusion coefficients and allows unravelling of heterogeneously diffusing populations.},

Further, we found that strong confinement of gold-labeled $\mu$OR could be induced by the prolonged on-ice preincubation of the gold probe with the cells, showing that this procedure should be avoided in future single-particle tracking experiments. Based on the dense, long trajectories of $\mu$OR obtained by high-speed single-particle tracking, the membrane compartments apposed and adjoined to each other could be defined that are delimited by rather straight boundaries, consistent with the involvement of actin filaments in membrane compartmentalization.},

These definitions, detergent solubility to define components of rafts, and sensitivity to cholesterol deprivation to define raft functions implicated sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in many cell functions. Despite extensive work, the basis for raft formation in cell membranes and the size of rafts and their stability are all uncertain. Recent work converges on very small rafts $<$10 nm in diameter that may enlarge and stabilize when their constituents are cross-linked.},

In addition to the expected molecules immobilized at one cell pole, we observed molecules moving throughout the cell membrane. By tracking the positions of these molecules for several seconds, we determined a diffusion coefficient (D) of 12 $\pm$ 2 \texttimes{} 10\textendash{}3 $\mu$m2/s for the mobile copies of PleC not bound at the cell pole. This D value is maintained across all cell cycle stages. We observe a reduced D at poles containing localized PleC-EYFP; otherwise D is independent of the position of the diffusing molecule within the bacterium. We did not detect any directional bias in the motion of the PleC-EYFP molecules, implying that the molecules are not being actively transported.},

Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR, 18 kDa) or a larger fusion protein, NusA-DHFR (72 kDa), binds reversibly but with high affinity to a methotrexate-modified lipid (MTX-PE) incorporated into large unilamellar vesicles. Incorporation of phosphatidylethanolamine-PEG5000 into the vesicles strongly decreases the affinity of binding of both proteins, to a degree that varies roughly exponentially with the lateral density of the PEG chains. Covalently coupling maltose-binding protein (MBP) to the vesicle surfaces also strongly decreases the affinity of binding of NusDHFR or DHFR, to a degree that likewise varies roughly exponentially with the surface density of anchored MBP. Surface-coupled MBP strongly decreases the rate of binding of NusDHFR to MTX-PE-incorporating vesicles but does not affect the rate of NusDHFR dissociation. The large magnitudes of these effects (easily exceeding an order of magnitude for moderate degrees of surface crowding) support previous theoretical analyses and~suggest that surface-crowding effects can markedly influence a variety of important aspects of protein behavior in membranes.},

  abstract = {The organization of the plasma membrane is both highly complex and highly dynamic. One manifestation of this dynamic complexity is the lateral mobility of proteins within the plane of the membrane, which is often an important determinant of intermolecular protein-binding interactions, downstream signal transduction, and local membrane mechanics. The mode of membrane protein mobility can range from random Brownian motion to immobility and from confined or restricted motion to actively directed motion. Several methods can be used to distinguish among the various modes of protein mobility, including fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, single-particle tracking, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and variations of these techniques. Here, we present both a brief overview of these methods and examples of their use to elucidate the dynamics of membrane proteins in mammalian cells\textemdash{}first in erythrocytes, then in erythroblasts and other cells in the hematopoietic lineage, and finally in non-hematopoietic cells. This multisystem analysis shows that the cytoskeleton frequently governs modes of membrane protein motion by stably anchoring the proteins through direct-binding interactions, by restricting protein diffusion through steric interactions, or by facilitating directed protein motion. Together, these studies have begun to delineate mechanisms by which membrane protein dynamics influence signaling sequelae and membrane mechanical properties, which, in turn, govern cell function.},

When the various isoforms were compared in 3T3 cells, FRAP studies showed both GPI-anchored and transmembrane isoforms diffused rapidly and only small differences in either the diffusion coefficients (D) or the mobile fractions (mf) were measured, suggesting the importance of the ectodomain in regulating lateral diffusion. However, the mobility of all NCAM isoforms was greatly reduced in regions of cell-cell contact, presumably due to homophilic trans interactions between NCAMs on adjacent cells. NCAM isoforms transfected into C2C12 cells which express NCAM naturally usually displayed a significantly lower D compared to the same isoforms transfected into 3T3 cells. Thus, NCAM lateral mobility is modulated in regions where cells interact and by the structure of the host cell membrane.},

  abstract = {In cell membranes, proteins and lipids diffuse in a highly crowded and heterogeneous landscape, where aggregates and dense domains of proteins or lipids obstruct the path of diffusing molecules. In general, hindered motion gives rise to anomalous transport, though the nature of the onset of this behavior is still under debate and difficult to investigate experimentally. Here, we present a systematic study where proteins bound to supported lipid membranes diffuse freely in two dimensions, but are increasingly hindered by the presence of other like proteins. In our model system, the surface coverage of the protein avidin on the lipid bilayer is well controlled by varying the concentration of biotinylated lipid anchors. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), we measure the time correlation function over long times and convert it to the mean-square displacement of the diffusing proteins. Our approach allows for high precision data and a clear distinction between anomalous and normal diffusion. It enables us to investigate the onset of anomalous diffusion, which takes place when the area coverage of membrane proteins increases beyond approximately 5\%. This transition region exhibits pronounced spatial heterogeneities. Upon increasing the packing fraction further, transport becomes more and more anomalous, manifested in a decrease of the exponent of subdiffusion.},

Anomalous diffusion, in which mean squared displacement does not increase linearly with time, is predicted in simulations of solute diffusion in media crowded with fixed or mobile obstacles, or when solute diffusion is restricted or accelerated by a variety of geometric or active transport processes. Experimental measurements of solute diffusion in solutions and cellular aqueous compartments, however, generally show Brownian diffusion. In cell membranes, there are examples of both Brownian and anomalous diffusion, with the latter likely produced by lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions. We conclude that the notion of universally anomalous diffusion in cells as a consequence of molecular crowding is not correct and that slowing of diffusion in cells is less marked than has been generally assumed.},

Our laboratory discovered that aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is the protein responsible for OAP formation by demonstrating OAPs in AQP4-transfected cells and absence of OAPs in AQP4 knockout mice. We recently developed live-cell, single-molecule imaging methods to study AQP4 diffusion and interactions in OAPs. The methods include single particle tracking of quantum-dot labeled AQP4, and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and small fluorophore-labeled AQP4. The full-length (M1) form of AQP4 diffuses freely in membranes and does not form OAPs, whereas the shorter (M23) form of AQP4 forms OAPs and is nearly immobile. Analysis of a series of AQP4 truncations, point mutants and chimeras revealed that OAP formation by AQP4-M23 is stabilized by hydrophobic tetramer-tetramer interactions involving N-terminus residues, and that absence of OAPs in AQP4-M1 results from blocking of this interaction by residues just upstream from Met23. These biophysical methods are being extended to identify the cellular site of AQP4 assembly, AQP4 isoform interactions, OAP size and dynamics, and the determinants of regulated OAP assembly.},

Cholesterol depletion caused a decrease in the diffusion coefficients for the MHC II proteins and also for a slow fraction of the Tritc-DHPE population.

The fractality enforces an initial power-law behavior of the autocorrelation function and related quantities for small times. Using this information, we show by FCS that Golgi resident membrane proteins move subdiffusively in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus in vivo. Based on Monte Carlo simulations for FCS on curved surfaces, we can rule out that the observed anomalous diffusion is a result of the complex topology of the membrane. The apparent mobility of particles as determined by FCS, however, is shown to depend crucially on the shape of the membrane and its motion in time. Due to this fact, the hydrodynamic radius of the tracked particles can be easily overestimated by an order of magnitude.},

For $>$30 years, it has been thought that hardly any information on the size of the diffusing object can be extracted from such experiments. Indeed, the hydrodynamic model developed by Saffman and Delbr\"uck predicts a weak, logarithmic dependence of the diffusion coefficient D with the radius R of the protein. Despite widespread use, its validity has never been thoroughly investigated. To check this model, we measured the diffusion coefficients of various peptides and transmembrane proteins, incorporated into giant unilamellar vesicles of 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SOPC) or in model bilayers of tunable thickness. We show in this work that, for several integral proteins spanning a large range of sizes, the diffusion coefficient is strongly linked to the protein dimensions. A heuristic model results in a Stokes-like expression for D, (D $\propto$ 1/R), which fits literature data as well as ours. Diffusion measurement is then a fast and fruitful method; it allows determining the oligomerization degree of proteins or studying lipid\textendash{}protein and protein\textendash{}protein interactions within bilayers.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms by which the diffusion rate in the plasma membrane (PM) is regulated remain unresolved, despite their importance in spatially regulating the reaction rates in the PM. Proposed models include entrapment in nanoscale noncontiguous domains found in PtK2 cells, slow diffusion due to crowding, and actin-induced compartmentalization. Here, by applying single-particle tracking at high time resolutions, mainly to the PtK2-cell-PM, we found confined diffusion + hop movements (termed ``hop diffusion'') for both a non-raft phospholipid and a transmembrane (TM) protein, transferrin receptor (TfR), and the equal compartment sizes for these two molecules in all five of the cell lines used here (actual sizes were cell-dependent), even after actin-modulating-drug treatments. The cross-section size and the cytoplasmic domain size both affected the hop frequency. Electron tomography identified the actin-based membrane skeleton (MSK) located within 8.8 nm from the PM cytoplasmic surface of PtK2 cells, and demonstrated that the MSK mesh size was the same as the compartment size for the PM molecular diffusion. The extracellular matrix and extracellular domains of membrane proteins were not involved in hop diffusion. These results support the model of anchored-TM-protein pickets lining the actin-based MSK, as a major mechanism for regulating diffusion.},

  issn = {0005-2736},
  doi = {10.1016/j.bbamem.2015.12.021},
  abstract = {Cellular membranes are typically decorated with a plethora of embedded and adsorbed macromolecules, e.g. proteins, that participate in numerous vital processes. With typical surface densities of 30,000 proteins per $\mu$m2 cellular membranes are indeed crowded places that leave only few nanometers of private space for individual proteins. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of protein crowding in membrane systems. We first give a brief overview on state-of-the-art approaches in experiment and simulation that are frequently used to study crowded membranes. After that, we review how crowding can affect diffusive transport of proteins and lipids in membrane systems. Next, we discuss lipid and protein sorting in crowded membrane systems, including effects like protein cluster formation, phase segregation, and lipid droplet formation. Subsequently, we highlight recent progress in uncovering crowding-induced conformational changes of membranes, e.g. membrane budding and vesicle formation. Finally, we give a short outlook on potential future developments in the field of crowded membrane systems.

  abstract = {The aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of small membrane-spanning proteins (monomer size $\sim$30 kDa) that are expressed at plasma membranes in many cells types involved in fluid transport. This review is focused on the molecular structure and function of mammalian aquaporins. Basic features of aquaporin structure have been defined using mutagenesis, epitope tagging, and spectroscopic and freeze-fracture electron microscopy methods. Aquaporins appear to assemble in membranes as homotetramers in which each monomer, consisting of six membrane-spanning $\alpha$-helical domains with cytoplasmically oriented amino and carboxy termini, contains a distinct water pore. Medium-resolution structural analysis by electron cryocrystallography indicated that the six tilted helical segments form a barrel surrounding a central pore-like region that contains additional protein density. Several of the mammalian aquaporins (e.g., AQP1, AQP2, AQP4, and AQP5) appear to be highly selective for the passage of water, whereas others (recently termed aquaglyceroporins) also transport glycerol (e.g., AQP3 and AQP8) and even larger solutes (AQP9). Evidence for possible movement of ions and carbon dioxide through the aquaporins is reviewed here, as well as evidence for direct regulation of aquaporin function by posttranslational modification such as phosphorylation. Important unresolved issues include definition of the molecular pathway through which water and solutes move, the nature of monomer-monomer interactions, and the physiological significance of aquaporin-mediated solute movement. Recent results from knockout mice implicating multiple physiological roles of aquaporins suggest that the aquaporins may be suitable targets for drug discovery by structure-based and/or high-throughput screening strategies.},

Although the validity of Batchelor's boundary condition is obvious, that of ours was not. We show how our boundary condition is justified and suggest that the two methods lead to identical results for the self-diffusion coefficient in spite of the different boundary conditions.

To date, a systematic approach for describing inter-species interactions has been lacking. Here we independently predict the competitive and cooperative potential between 6,903 bacterial pairs derived from a collection of 118 species' metabolic models. We chart an intricate association between competition and cooperation indicating that the cooperative potential is maximized at moderate levels of resource overlap. Utilizing ecological data from 2,801 samples, we explore the associations between bacterial interactions and coexistence patterns. The high level of competition observed between species with mutual-exclusive distribution patterns supports the role of competition in community assembly. Cooperative interactions are typically unidirectional with no obvious benefit to the giver. However, within their natural communities, bacteria typically form close cooperative loops resulting in indirect benefit to all species involved. These findings are important for the future design of consortia optimized towards bioremediation and bio-production applications.},

Here we show that a well-organized and robust division of labour can evolve in a matter of days. Mutants emerge within bacterial colonies and work with the parent strain to gain new territory. The two strains self-organize in space: one provides a wetting polymer at the colony edge, whereas the other sits behind and pushes them both along. The emergence of the interaction is repeatable, bidirectional and only requires a single mutation to alter production of the intracellular messenger, cyclic-di-GMP. Our work demonstrates the power of the division of labour to rapidly solve biological problems without the need for long-term evolution or derived sociality. We predict that the division of labour will evolve frequently in microbial populations, where rapid genetic diversification is common.},

  abstract = {The instructions that a cell needs to build proteins are encoded within its genes. To make proteins, these instructions are first copied into molecules of messenger RNA (or mRNA for short). Molecular machines called ribosomes then translate these mRNA molecules to produce proteins. Controlling when and where proteins are produced within a cell is important for tissue development, memory formation in the brain, and the outcome of certain cancers. Methods that can pinpoint the time and place that translation occurs will lead to an improved understanding of how biological processes take place. While current techniques can be used to track the movement of single mRNA molecules in individual cells, it has not yet been possible to determine whether ribosomes are actively translating these mRNAs. Katz, English et al. tracked the movements of mRNA molecules (that encode a protein called $\beta$-actin) and ribosomes at the same time, by using fluorescent tags with different colors. $\beta$-actin is an important component of the cell's internal scaffolding and its localized translation enables cells to move in a given direction. Katz, English et al. confirmed that $\beta$-actin mRNA translation most often occurs near the leading edge of a moving cell, especially near sites where the cell attaches to its surroundings to help pull itself forward. The experiments also revealed that mRNAs that are being translated behaved differently to mRNAs that are not being translated. In particular, translating mRNAs and their associated ribosomes move much slower than non-translating mRNAs. Importantly, this method can be applied to any mRNA of interest, and once the movements of the mRNA have been defined it is possible to estimate whether or not it is being translated.

A number of studies have questioned the ability of peer review panels to predict the productivity of applications, but a recent analysis of grants funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US found that the percentile scores awarded by peer review panels correlated with productivity as measured by citations of grant-supported publications. Here, based on a re-analysis of these data for the 102,740 funded grants with percentile scores of 20 or better, we report that these percentile scores are a poor discriminator of productivity. This underscores the limitations of peer review as a means of assessing grant applications in an era when typical success rates are often as low as about 10\%.},

In contrast, molecular phenotype data, such as gene expression levels, are generally assumed to be free of such identifying information. Although there is no explicit genotypic information in phenotype data, adversaries can statistically link phenotypes to genotypes using publicly available genotype-phenotype correlations such as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). This linking can be accurate when high-dimensional data (i.e., many expression levels) are used, and the resulting links can then reveal sensitive information (for example, the fact that an individual has cancer). Here we develop frameworks for quantifying the leakage of characterizing information from phenotype data sets. These frameworks can be used to estimate the leakage from large data sets before release. We also present a general three-step procedure for practically instantiating linking attacks and a specific attack using outlier gene expression levels that is simple yet accurate. Finally, we describe the effectiveness of this outlier attack under different scenarios.},

Deep sequencing of DNase-seq libraries and computational analysis of the cut profiles have been used to infer protein occupancy in the genome at the nucleotide level, a method introduced as 'digital genomic footprinting'. The approach has been proposed as an attractive alternative to the analysis of transcription factors (TFs) by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), and in theory it should overcome antibody issues, poor resolution and batch effects. Recent reports point to limitations of the DNase-based genomic footprinting approach and call into question the scope of detectable protein occupancy, especially for TFs with short-lived chromatin binding. The genomics community is grappling with issues concerning the utility of genomic footprinting and is reassessing the proposed approaches in terms of robust deliverables. Here we summarize the consensus as well as different views emerging from recent reports, and we describe the remaining issues and hurdles for genomic footprinting.},

Recording the activity of large populations of neurons is an important step toward understanding the~emergent function of neural circuits.

We use prior knowledge of neuronal locations, activity sparsity, and a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm to extract signals from neurons imaged simultaneously and located in different focal planes or fields of view. Our laser multiplexing approach is simple and fast, and could be used as a general method to image the activity of neural circuits in three dimensions across multiple areas in the brain.},

Numer. Anal. 40, no. 3, 1041-1063]. In this article we answer this question to the negative and prove for a large class of stochastic differential equations with non-globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients that Euler's approximation converges neither in the strong mean square sense nor in the numerically weak sense to the exact solution at a finite time point. Even worse, the difference of the exact solution and of the numerical approximation at a finite time point diverges to infinity in the strong mean square sense and in the numerically weak sense.},

  abstract = {Many stochastic differential equations that occur in financial modelling do not satisfy the standard assumptions made in convergence proofs of numerical schemes that are given in textbooks, i.e., their coefficients and the corresponding derivatives appearing in the proofs are not uniformly bounded and hence, in particular, not globally Lipschitz. Specific examples are the Heston and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross models with square root coefficients and the Ait-Sahalia model with rational coefficient functions. Simple examples show that, for example, the Euler-Maruyama scheme may not converge either in the strong or weak sense when the standard assumptions do not hold. Nevertheless, new convergence results have been obtained recently for many such models in financial mathematics. These are reviewed here. Although weak convergence is of traditional importance in financial mathematics with its emphasis on expectations of functionals of the solutions, strong convergence plays a crucial role in Multi Level Monte Carlo methods, so it and also pathwise convergence will be considered along with methods which preserve the positivity of the solutions.},

  abstract = {A model of the chemostat involving two populations of microorganisms competing for two complementary, growth-limiting substrates is considered. Instead of assuming the familiar Michaelis-Menten kinetics for nutrient uptake, a general class of functions is used which includes all monotone increasing uptake functions, but which also allows uptake functions that describe inhibition by the substrate at high concentrations. Graphical techniques are developed to analyze the model. In the case of monotone kinetics the results are similar to those of Hsu, Cheng, and Hubbell [16], who study this problem assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics. For monotone kinetics, all dynamics are trivial in the sense that all solutions approach equilibria. However, when at least one of the competitors is inhibited by high concentrations of the substrate, one can easily construct examples for which there is a stable periodic solution. Surprisingly, if the substrates are inhibitory at high concentrations, there are examples for which coexistence is possible but neither competitor can survive in the absence of its rival.},

There exist conditions that permit the stable coexistence of the competitors, provided that the sensitive species is more efficient in exploiting the limiting resource, and the resistant species removes the inhibitor from the environment. There exists a subset of these conditions wherein the sensitive species can become established if and only if the resistant species is already established. If the resistant species does not remove the inhibitor from the environment, then coexistence of sensitive and resistant species is structurally unstable. If the resistant species produces the inhibitor, then coexistence is dynamically unstable.

It is also shown that all four classical outcomes, including the case in which winning depends on the initial abundances of the competitors, can arise for this purely exploitative competition.

  abstract = {``It is well known that two microbial populations competing for a single nutrient in a homogeneous environment with time-invariant inputs cannot coexist in a steady-state'' (Baltzis \&amp; Fredrickson, 1983). It is perhaps less well known that an arbitrarily small deviation from the single nutrient dependence, homogeneity or time-invariance renders this statement invalid. This paper establishes that the theory of simple competition of two species for a single growth-limiting substrate is structurally unstable. Conclusions based on such a theory therefore cannot be expected, a priori, to apply to systems for which there exist even small deviations from simple competition. It then becomes necessary to establish how the conclusions are modified under the introduction of such perturbations. The presence of an additional substrate, for which both species exhibit a weak affinity of O($\varepsilon$), gives rise to new phenomena, but only within an interval of dilution rates whose extent decreases with $\varepsilon$. However, within this interval either stable coexistence or conditional exclusion occurs, depending on the relative affinities for the additional substrate. Such states persist for arbitrarily small $\varepsilon$, though their observability and significance decreases with $\varepsilon$. These conclusions are independent of the particular functional forms used to model the substrate dependence, and characterize an entire class of competitive systems in which specific models based on Michaelis-Menten, Monod, Holling or sigmoidal type kinetics arise as particular instances. Despite the impossibility of ever establishing with limitless accuracy whether an observed system is purely one of simple competition for a single growth-limiting substrate, conclusions based on the theory of simple competition, such as the principle of competitive exclusion, have been universally applied to understand species diversity and community structure. This paper formulates those predictions of the theory of simple competition which survive small perturbations in the structure of the system, enabling conclusions such as the principle of competitive exclusion to be applied in a consistent manner.},

Here it is contended that the dynamics of resource supply and exploitation must be explicitly taken into account if these conditions are to be obtained in any accurate form. First, the distinction between perfectly substitutable, imperfectly substitutable and perfectly complementary resources is examined. This leads to an array of models intended to mirror interspecific exploitative competition for two resources for each category considered. Then, the conditions for the coexistence of the two competitors in each case are derived and presented with direct reference to the modes of resource use.},

Here we apply a multi-omic modelling workflow that combines genomic, transcriptomic and physiological data with genome-scale models to investigate dynamics and electron flow mechanisms in the syntrophic association of Geobacter metallireducens and Geobacter sulfurreducens. Genome-scale modelling of direct interspecies electron transfer reveals insights into the energetics of electron transfer mechanisms. While G. sulfurreducens adapts to rapid syntrophic growth by changes at the genomic and transcriptomic level, G. metallireducens responds only at the transcriptomic level. This multi-omic approach enhances our understanding of adaptive responses and factors that shape the evolution of syntrophic communities.},

To enhance our understanding of these relationships, we took advantage of the fully sequenced genomes of Desulfovibrio vulgaris and Methanococcus maripaludis to produce and analyze the first multispecies stoichiometric metabolic model. Model results were compared to data on growth of the co-culture on lactate in the absence of sulfate. The model accurately predicted several ecologically relevant characteristics, including the flux of metabolites and the ratio of D. vulgaris to M. maripaludis cells during growth. In addition, the model and our data suggested that it was possible to eliminate formate as an interspecies electron shuttle, but hydrogen transfer was essential for syntrophic growth. Our work demonstrated that reconstructed metabolic networks and stoichiometric models can serve not only to predict metabolic fluxes and growth phenotypes of single organisms, but also to capture growth parameters and community composition of simple bacterial communities.},

We show that a subcritical Hopf bifurcation from the coexistence equilibrium together with a repelling heteroclinic cycle leads to the existence of at least two limit cycles enclosing the coexistence equilibrium on the carrying simplex- the ‘‘inside'' one is an unstable separatrix and the ‘‘outside'' one is at least semi-stable relative to the carrying simplex. Numerical simulations suggest that there are exactly two limit cycles and that almost every positive solution approaches either the stable limit cycle or the stable coexistence equilibrium, depending on initial conditions. Bifurcation diagrams confirm this picture and show additional features. In an alternative scenario, we show that the subcritical Hopf together with an attracting heteroclinic cycle leads to an unstable periodic orbit separatrix.},

  abstract = {A graphical technique is given for determining the outcome of two species competition for two resources. This method is unifying in the sense that the graphical criterion leading to the various outcomes of competition are consistent across most of the spectrum of resource types (from those that fulfill the same growth needs to those that fulfill different needs) regardless of the classification method used, and the resulting graphs bear a striking resemblance to the well-known phase portraits for two species Lotka\textendash{}Volterra competition. Our graphical method complements that of Tilman. Both include zero net growth isoclines. However, instead of using the consumption vectors at potential coexistence equilibria to determine input resource concentrations leading to specific competitive outcomes, we introduce curves bounding the feasible set (the set where the resource concentrations of any equilibrium solution must be located). The washout equilibrium (corresponding to the supply point) occurs at an intersection of curves defining the feasible set boundary. The resource concentrations of all other equilibria are found where zero net growth isoclines either intersect each other inside the feasible set or they intersect the feasible set boundary. A species has positive biomass at such an equilibrium only if its zero net growth isocline is involved in such an intersection. The competitive outcomes are then determined from the position of the single species equilibria, just as in the phase portrait analysis for classical competition (rather than from information at potential coexistence equilibria as in Tilman's method).},

  abstract = {The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 system has become a powerful and precise tool for targeted gene modification (e.g., gene knockout and gene replacement) in numerous eukaryotic organisms. Initial attempts to apply this technology to a model, the single-cell alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, failed to yield cells containing edited genes. To determine if the Cas9 and single guide RNA (sgRNA) genes were functional in C. reinhardtii, we tested the ability of a codon-optimized Cas9 gene along with one of four different sgRNAs to cause targeted gene disruption during a 24-h period immediately following transformation. All three exogenously supplied gene targets as well as the endogenous FKB12 (rapamycin sensitivity) gene of C. reinhardtii displayed distinct Cas9/sgRNA-mediated target site modifications as determined by DNA sequencing of cloned PCR amplicons of the target site region. Success in transient expression of Cas9 and sgRNA genes contrasted with the recovery of only a single rapamycin-resistant colony bearing an appropriately modified FKB12 target site in 16 independent transformation experiments involving $>$10(9) cells. Failure to recover transformants with intact or expressed Cas9 genes following transformation with the Cas9 gene alone (or even with a gene encoding a Cas9 lacking nuclease activity) provided strong suggestive evidence for Cas9 toxicity when Cas9 is produced constitutively in C. reinhardtii. The present results provide compelling evidence that Cas9 and sgRNA genes function properly in C. reinhardtii to cause targeted gene modifications and point to the need for a focus on development of methods to properly stem Cas9 production and/or activity following gene editing.},

  abstract = {Microalgae-based biofuels are promising sources of alternative energy, but improvements throughout the production process are required to establish them as economically feasible. One of the most influential improvements would be a significant increase in lipid yields, which could be achieved by altering the regulation of lipid biosynthesis and accumulation. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii accumulates oil (triacylglycerols, TAG) in response to nitrogen (N) deprivation. Although a few important regulatory genes have been identified that are involved in controlling this process, a global understanding of the larger regulatory network has not been developed. In order to uncover this network in this species, a combined omics (transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic) analysis was applied to cells grown in a time course experiment after a shift from N-replete to N-depleted conditions. Changes in transcript and protein levels of 414 predicted transcription factors (TFs) and transcriptional regulators (TRs) were monitored relative to other genes. The TF and TR genes were thus classified by two separate measures: up-regulated versus down-regulated and early response versus late response relative to two phases of polar lipid synthesis (before and after TAG biosynthesis initiation). Lipidomic and primary metabolite profiling generated compound accumulation levels that were integrated with the transcript dataset and TF profiling to produce a transcriptional regulatory network. Evaluation of this proposed regulatory network led to the identification of several regulatory hubs that control many aspects of cellular metabolism, from N assimilation and metabolism, to central metabolism, photosynthesis and lipid metabolism.},

  abstract = {Algal lipids are the focus of intensive research because they are potential sources of biodiesel. However, most algae produce neutral lipids only under stress conditions. Here, we report that treatment with Brefeldin A (BFA), a chemical inducer of ER stress, rapidly triggers lipid droplet (LD) formation in two different microalgal species,  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  and  Chlorella vulgaris.  LD staining using Nile red revealed that BFA-treated algal cells exhibited many more fluorescent bodies than control cells. Lipid analyses based on thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography revealed that the additional lipids formed upon BFA treatment were mainly triacylglycerols (TAGs). The increase in TAG accumulation was accompanied by a decrease in the betaine lipid diacylglyceryl  N,N,N -trimethylhomoserine (DGTS), a major component of the extraplastidic membrane lipids in  Chlamydomonas , suggesting that at least some of the TAGs were assembled from the degradation products of membrane lipids. Interestingly, BFA induced TAG accumulation in the  Chlamydomonas  cells regardless of the presence or absence of an acetate or nitrogen source in the medium. This effect of BFA in  Chlamydomonas  cells seems to be due to BFA-induced ER stress, as supported by the induction of three homologs of ER stress marker genes by the drug. Together, these results suggest that ER stress rapidly triggers TAG accumulation in two green microalgae,  C. reinhardtii  and  C. vulgaris.  A further investigation of the link between ER stress and TAG synthesis may yield an efficient means of producing biofuel from algae.},

These models are permanent if there exists a positive global attractor and are robustly permanent if they remain permanent following perturbations of A i ( x ) . Necessary and sufficient conditions for robust permanence are derived using dominant Lyapunov exponents $\lambda$ i ( $\mu$ ) of the A i ( x ) with respect to invariant measures $\mu$. The necessary condition requires max i $\lambda$ i ( $\mu$ ) \&gt; 0 for all ergodic measures with support in the boundary of the non-negative cone. The sufficient condition requires that the boundary admits a Morse decomposition such that max i $\lambda$ i ( $\mu$ ) \&gt; 0 for all invariant measures $\mu$ supported by a component of the Morse decomposition. When the Morse components are Axiom A, uniquely ergodic, or support all but one population, the necessary and sufficient conditions are equivalent. Applications to spatial ecology, epidemiology, and gene networks are given.},

  title = {Discovery and Dissection of Metabolic Oscillations in the Microaerobic Nitric Oxide Response Network of {{Escherichia}} Coli},
  abstract = {The virulence of many pathogens depends upon their ability to cope with immune-generated nitric oxide (NO$\cdot$). In Escherichia coli, the major NO$\cdot$ detoxification systems are Hmp, an NO$\cdot$ dioxygenase (NOD), and NorV, an NO$\cdot$ reductase (NOR). It is well established that Hmp is the dominant system under aerobic conditions, whereas NorV dominates anaerobic conditions; however, the quantitative contributions of these systems under the physiologically relevant microaerobic regime remain ill defined. Here, we investigated NO$\cdot$ detoxification in environments ranging from 0 to 50 $\mu$M O2, and discovered a regime in which E. coli NO$\cdot$ defenses were severely compromised, as well as conditions that exhibited oscillations in the concentration of NO$\cdot$. Using an integrated computational and experimental approach, E. coli NO$\cdot$ detoxification was found to be extremely impaired at low O2 due to a combination of its inhibitory effects on NorV, Hmp, and translational activities, whereas oscillations were found to result from a kinetic competition for O2 between Hmp and respiratory cytochromes. Because at least 777 different bacterial species contain the genetic requirements of this stress response oscillator, we hypothesize that such oscillatory behavior could be a widespread phenomenon. In support of this hypothesis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whose respiratory and NO$\cdot$ response networks differ considerably from those of E. coli, was found to exhibit analogous oscillations in low O2 environments. This work provides insight into how bacterial NO$\cdot$ defenses function under the low O2 conditions that are likely to be encountered within host environments.},

We determine the conditions for positive steady states of the two species, and then consider the global attractors of the model. In addition, we obtain the conditions under which the two populations uniformly strongly persist or go to extinction. Since the diffusion mechanism with homogeneous boundary conditions inhibits the growth of the organism species, it can be understood that the coexistence will be ensured by proportionally smaller diffusions for the two species. In particular, it is found that both instability and bi-stability subcases of the two semitrivial steady states are included in the coexistence region. The two populations will go to extinction when both possess large diffusion rates. If just one of them spreads faster with the other one diffusing slower, then the related semitrivial steady state will be globally attracting. The techniques used for the above results consist of the degree theory, the semigroup theory, and the maximum principle.},

By assuming that species i is limited by resource i for each i near the positive equilibrium, and that the matrix of contents of resources in species is a combination of cyclic matrix and a symmetric matrix, we obtain an asymptotically stable periodic solution of three species on three resources via Hopf bifurcation. A simple bifurcation argument is then employed which allows us to add a fourth species. In principle, the argument can be continued to obtain a periodic solution adding one new species at a time so long as asymptotic stability can be assured at each step. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate our analytical results. The results of this paper suggest that competition can generate coexistence of species in the form of periodic cycles, and that the number of coexisting species can exceed the number of resources in a constant and homogeneous environment.},

For this purpose, we use a competition model concerned with competition for abiotic essential resources. Because phytoplankton and plants consume quite a number of abiotic essential resources, the model is particularly relevant for phytoplankton communities and terrestrial vegetation. We show that the predicted dynamics depend crucially on the relationship between the resource requirements and the resource consumption characteristics of the species. More specifically, the model predicts that competition generates (1) stable coexistence if species consume most of the resources for which they have high requirements, (2) oscillations and chaos if species consume most of the resources for which they have intermediate requirements, and (3) competitive exclusion with a winner that depends on the initial conditions if species consume most of the resources for which they have low requirements. The theoretical predictions are compared with available data on resource utilization patterns of phytoplankton species.},

We consider here a generalization with four species, the minimum number of species allowing other interactions beyond the single loop (one predator, one prey). We show that, contrary to the mean field prediction, on a square lattice the model presents a transition, as the parameter setting the rate at which one species invades another changes, from a coexistence to a state in which one species gets extinct. Such a dependence on the invasion rates shows that the interaction graph structure alone is not enough to predict the outcome of such models. In addition, different invasion rates permit to tune the level of transitiveness, indicating that for the coexistence of all species to persist, there must be a minimum amount of intransitivity.},

Recently, Huisman \& Weissing (1999, 2000) showed, in a model study, that the number of coexisting species may exceed the number of limiting resources when internal system feedback induces oscillations or chaos. In this paper, we use the term ``supersaturated coexistence'' for this phenomenon. On the basis of these findings, they claimed that the paradox of the plankton is solved. We investigated the prerequisites for supersaturated coexistence in the same model. Our results indicate that supersaturated coexistence is a rare phenomenon in parameter space, requires a very precise parameterization of the community members and is sensitive to the introduction of new species and the removal of the present species. This raises the question of whether supersaturated coexistence is likely to occur in nature. We conclude that the claim by Huisman \& Weissing (1999, 2000) is premature.},

As predicted, on average, increased levels of intransitivity result in more sustained coexistence within simulated communities, although the outcome of competition also becomes increasingly unpredictable. Interestingly, even a moderate degree of intransitivity within a community can promote coexistence, in terms of both the length of time until the first competitive exclusion and the number of species remaining in the community after 500 simulated generations. These results suggest that modest levels of intransitivity in nature, such as those that are thought to be characteristic of plant communities, can contribute to coexistence and, therefore, community-scale biodiversity. We explore a potential connection between competitive intransitivity and neutral theory, whereby competitive intransitivity may represent an important mechanism for ``ecological equivalence.''},

Their composition is thought to be largely shaped by interspecies competition for the available resources, but cooperative interactions, such as metabolite exchanges, have also been implicated in community assembly. The prevalence of metabolic interactions in microbial communities, however, has remained largely unknown. Here, we systematically survey, by using a genome-scale metabolic modeling approach, the extent of resource competition and metabolic exchanges in over 800 communities. We find that, despite marked resource competition at the level of whole assemblies, microbial communities harbor metabolically interdependent groups that recur across diverse habitats. By enumerating flux-balanced metabolic exchanges in these co-occurring subcommunities we also predict the likely exchanged metabolites, such as amino acids and sugars, that can promote group survival under nutritionally challenging conditions. Our results highlight metabolic dependencies as a major driver of species co-occurrence and hint at cooperative groups as recurring modules of microbial community architecture.},

The two strains self-organize in space: one provides a wetting polymer at the colony edge, whereas the other sits behind and pushes them both along. The emergence of the interaction is repeatable, bidirectional and only requires a single mutation to alter production of the intracellular messenger, cyclic-di-GMP. Our work demonstrates the power of the division of labour to rapidly solve biological problems without the need for long-term evolution or derived sociality. We predict that the division of labour will evolve frequently in microbial populations, where rapid genetic diversification is common.},

Genome-scale metabolic networks are used to characterize the metabolic functions of microbial communities via several techniques including species compartmentalization, separating species-level and community-level objectives, dynamic analysis, the `enzyme-soup' approach, multiscale modeling, and others. There are many challenges in the field, including a need for tools that accurately assign high-level omics signals to individual community members, the need for improved automated network reconstruction methods, and novel algorithms for integrating omics data and engineering communities.

According to the law of chemical equilibrium, the consumption of excreted metabolites by recipient microbes can accelerate the metabolism of donor microbes. This is the concept of syntrophy, which is a type of mutualism and governs the metabolism and growth of diverse microbes in natural and engineered ecosystems. A representative example of syntrophy is found in methanogenic communities, where reducing equivalents, e.g., hydrogen and formate, transfer between syntrophic partners. Studies have revealed that microbes involved in syntrophy have evolved molecular mechanisms to establish specific partnerships and interspecies communication, resulting in efficient metabolic cooperation. In addition, recent studies have provided evidence suggesting that microbial interspecies transfer of reducing equivalents also occurs as electric current via biotic (e.g., pili) and abiotic (e.g., conductive mineral and carbon particles) electric conduits. In this review, we describe these findings as examples of sophisticated cooperative behavior between different microbial species. We suggest that these interactions have fundamental roles in shaping the structure and activity of microbial communities.},

This partitioning of benefits, also called `leakiness', can produce negative frequency dependence of fitness in microbial communities, allowing coexistence between function-performing helpers and function-requiring beneficiaries. The ubiquity of leakiness favors a `race to the bottom' as members of a community lose the ability to perform functions whose products are available from the environment. Rather than being social altruists, helpers are merely those populations that lost this race and got stuck in their role as function performers. Here I discuss many such BQ functions and the microbial communities that evolve around them. I also compile evidence from laboratory evolution experiments as well as phylogenetic reconstructions that show that organisms gain greater fitness increases from gene/function loss events than is commonly expected. Finally, I consider possible consequences of long-term BQ-stabilized coexistence, including sympatric speciation and the evolution of true mutualisms.},

For the weed-like superior competitor E. coli, its massive growth was suppressed by the elevated pH and the newly produced novel bisindole alkaloid hepchrome. For the inferior Streptomyces sp., its mycelium floated to the medium surface for further colonization, and the growth in liquid medium was inhibited by its self-produced alkaloids such as halichrome A, 1,1,1-Tris (3-indolyl) methane, vibrindole A, and hepchrome.

  abstract = {Microorganisms differ in their effectiveness in uptake and selection of substances that they bring in from the environment. They also differ in how they balance the allocation of nutrients for immediate and for delayed use. Moreover, they may not take up resources as fast as they seemingly could, and they may extrude derivatives of substances just pumped in. A good deal of these apparent choices must reside in the uptake systems and the linkage of these with the cell's intermediate metabolism. An important feature is that a resource may vary in concentration from time to time, nutrient to nutrient, and habitat to habitat. This variation must have been critical to the evolution of regulatory processes. Some possibilities for the combined uptake and consumption are considered for substrates serving the same (homologous) and different (heterologous) roles for the bacterium. From the membrane transport processes diagrammed in Fig. 1c and Fig. 2 and corresponding computer program given in Appendix A, the combined effect of uptake processes and cell growth can be studied. The model can be modified for various alternate models to study the possible control of cellular uptake and metabolism for the range of ecological roles of the bacterium. Figure 1 Models for bacterial growth. (a) The Monod model. Monod postulated, analogously to Michaelis\textendash{}Menten enzyme kinetics, that a reversible complex is formed between the substrate, S, and the bacterium, B. This complex is resolves to recover the original catalyst, i.e., the bacterium, and the product, which is a second bacterium. (b) The Best model. The external substrate, SE, diffuses reversibly through the cell membrane. When internal to the cell, where it is designated as SI, it reacts with a cell enzyme, E. This is the first step in its metabolism. The complex, in an irreversible reaction, regenerates the enzyme, produces a product, P, that then is used variously to supports different aspects of cell growth. (c) Linkage model. This model links uptake with consumption. A pathway for facilitated diffusion acts to bring the substrate into the cell via a membrane-bound carrier, T. All stages (binding, dissociating, traversing the membrane) are reversible. The substrate, on dissociation, reacts internally with the first enzyme in the intermediary metabolism pathway according to the usual kind of enzyme mechanism with a Km and a V${'}$max. Three regulatory mechanisms are shown: (i) by combination with a phosphate group by a two-component system; (ii) by overflow metabolism as the internal substrate is ejected from the cell in a transformed state, X; (iii) by storage within the cell as compound Y. Figure 2 Metabolic scheme for the linkage of uptake of two growth substrates. The transport system for both substrates was modeled from an earlier review [30]. It has been outlined in Fig. 1c. The symbols S, T, E, I stand for substrate, transporter, external, and internal substrate. These symbols have an A or B added to them depending on which transport system is involved. Rate constants have been designated, for example, by K13B instead of K13B. Also KMB is used instead of KMB and VmaxB instead of VmaxB, to designate Michaelis\textendash{}Menten constants and maximum velocities. In this scheme there are four forms of the free substrates and four forms of the transporter for each substrate. The 12 kinetic rate constants for each substrate should be considered the equivalents of the rate constants in chemical kinetics or in enzymology. The internal form of each kind of substrate, SIA and SIB, feeds into central metabolism at a maximum rate dependent on EA*K13A and EB*K13B when SIA or SIB are large relative to the binding constants, KMA or KMB (i.e., at saturation condition). The internal substrate may also be extruded in another form, XA and XB, or stored as a reserve material inside the cell, YA and YB. These phenomenological constants correspond to different kinetic forms for homologous and heterologous substrates as described in the text. The open-headed arrows present a possible control of the internal pools on that function by regulating TIA and TIB.},

The use of linearization and Fourier transformation to calculate a transfer function between driving variability in the environment, and the resulting trajectory of resource availability, is advocated. The modulus of this transfer function is an indicator of competitive ability in variable habitats, can be used to identify situations in which constant-yield models are inadequate approximations of variable-yield models, and to guide simulations or non-linear analyses.},

The model is analyzed in a simple set up of phytoplankton culture reactor. Conditions are specified for which steady phytoplankton existence state is stable. Since growth depends on internal nutrient content, the limiting nutrient may be recognized as the one having the smallest content in phytoplankton relative to the subsistence quota. According to the model, in steady state during equal limitation by several nutrients, the Redfield ratio is equal to the ratio of subsistence quotas and to the ratio of uptake rates. Contrary to wide spread use, the ratio of nutrients in water is not the Redfield ratio but a function of the growth rate. In oligotrophic waters, however, nutrients are in another ratio that may be used as an analog to the Redfield ratio in phytoplankton. The model may be used as a submodel of larger ecosystem models.},

We use a mathematical model of phytoplankton with flexible stoichiometry to explain patterns of phytoplankton composition in chemostat experiments and nutrient drawdown dynamics that are found in the field. Exponential growth and equilibrium represent two distinct phases, each amenable to mathematical analysis. In a chemostat at a fixed dilution (growth) rate, phytoplankton stoichiometry matches the nutrient supply stoichiometry over a wide range at low growth rates and over a narrow range at high growth rates. In a chemostat with a fixed nutrient supply stoichiometry, phytoplankton stoichiometry varies with dilution rate nonlinearly, between the supply stoichiometry at low dilution rates and a species-specific optimal ratio at high dilution rates. The flexible-stoichiometry model we study predicts low equilibrium concentrations of two nutrients over a wide range of supply ratios, contrary to the predictions of a traditional fixed-stoichiometry model. The model is in quantitative agreement with experimental data, except at extreme nutrient supply ratios, which require a negative feedback from quota to uptake to fit the data. Our analysis points to the importance of better understanding the regulation of uptake rates in determining phytoplankton stoichiometry and incorporating this knowledge into phytoplankton models.},

The use of Individual-based Modelling (IbM) allows us to probe deeper into the behaviour of individual cells; it is a bridge between theories and experiments when needed.

INDividual DIScrete SIMulation (INDISIM) has been developed and coded by our group as an IbM simulator and used to study bacterial growth, including the microscopic causes of the lag phase. First of all, the evolution of cellular masses, specifically the mean mass and biomass distribution, is shown to be a determining factor in the beginning of the exponential phase. Secondly, whenever there is a need for an enzyme synthesis, its rate has a direct effect on the lag duration. The variability of the lag phase with different factors is also studied. The known decrease of the lag phase with an increase in the temperature is also observed in the simulations.

An initial study of the relationship between individual and collective lag phases is presented, as a complement to the studies already published. One important result is the variability of the individual lag times and generation times. It has also been found that the mean of the individual lags is greater than the population lag.

This is the first in a series of studies of the lag phase that we are carrying out. Therefore, the present work addresses a generic system by making a simple set of assumptions.},

As predicted, on average, increased levels of intransitivity result in more sustained coexistence within simulated communities, although the outcome of competition also becomes increasingly unpredictable. Interestingly, even a moderate degree of intransitivity within a community can promote coexistence, in terms of both the length of time until the first competitive exclusion and the number of species remaining in the community after 500 simulated generations. These results suggest that modest levels of intransitivity in nature, such as those that are thought to be characteristic of plant communities, can contribute to coexistence and, therefore, community-scale biodiversity. We explore a potential connection between competitive intransitivity and neutral theory, whereby competitive intransitivity may represent an important mechanism for ``ecological equivalence.''},

The relevance of local stability to food web properties has been questioned because local stability holds only in the immediate vicinity of the equilibrium and provides no information about the size of the basin of attraction. Local stability does not guarantee persistence of food webs in stochastic environments. Moreover, local stability excludes more complex dynamics such as periodic and chaotic behaviors, which may allow persistence. Global stability and permanence could be better criteria of community persistence. Our simulation analysis suggests that these three stability measures are qualitatively consistent in that all three predict decreasing stability with increasing complexity. Some new predictions on how stability depends on food web configurations are generated here: a consumer\textendash{}victim link has a smaller effect on the probabilities of stability, as measured by all three stability criteria, than a pair of recipient-controlled and donor-controlled links; a recipient-controlled link has a larger effect on the probabilities of local stability and permanence than a donor-controlled link, while they have the same effect on the probability of global stability; food webs with equal proportions of donor-controlled and recipient-controlled links are less stable than those with different proportions.},

Earlier studies often assumed a community with only one interaction type, either an antagonistic, competitive, or mutualistic interaction, leaving open the question of what the diversity of interaction types contributes to the community maintenance. We show theoretically that the multiple interaction types might hold the key to understanding community dynamics. A moderate mixture of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions can stabilize population dynamics. Furthermore, increasing complexity leads to increased stability in a ``hybrid'' community. We hypothesize that the diversity of species and interaction types may be the essential element of biodiversity that maintains ecological communities.

Recent developments highlighted that this relationship depended on whether interactions were antagonistic or mutualistic. Different structures promoting stability in different types of ecological networks, i.e. mutualistic or antagonistic, have been pointed out. However, these findings come from studies considering mutualistic and antagonistic interactions separately whereas we know that species are part of both types of networks simultaneously. Understanding the relationship between network structure and community stability, when mutualistic and antagonistic interactions are merged in a single network, thus appears as the next challenge to improve our understanding of the dynamics of natural communities. Using a theoretical approach, we test whether the structural characteristics known to promote stability in networks made of a single interaction type still hold for network merging mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. We show that the effects of diversity and connectance remain unchanged. But the effects of nestedness and modularity are strongly weakened in networks combining mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. By challenging the stabilizing mechanisms proposed for networks with a single interaction type, our study calls for new measures of structure for networks that integrate the diversity of interaction.},

Recently, tools from random matrix theory have identified the main drivers of stability in ecological communities whose network structure is random. However, empirical food webs differ greatly from random graphs. For example, their degree distribution is broader, they contain few trophic cycles, and they are almost interval. Here we derive an approximation for the stability of food webs whose structure is generated by the cascade model, in which `larger' species consume `smaller' ones. We predict the stability of these food webs with great accuracy, and our approximation also works well for food webs whose structure is determined empirically or by the niche model. We find that intervality and broad degree distributions tend to stabilize food webs, and that average interaction strength has little influence on stability, compared with the effect of variance and correlation.},

We show that the stability of these microdomains depends on the integrity of the MreB cytoskeletal network underneath the membrane. We explore how the interplay between cytoskeleton and membrane affects trans-membrane protein (TMP) diffusion and reveal that the mobility of the TMPs tested is subdiffusive, most likely caused by confinement of TMP mobility by the submembranous MreB network. Our findings demonstrate that the dynamic architecture of prokaryotic cell membranes is controlled by the MreB cytoskeleton and regulates the mobility of TMPs.},

  abstract = {Stochastic properties of phage promoter
Full understanding of regulated gene expression requires characterization of stochastic variation in the activity of individual promoters. To avoid cell-to-cell variability and variation between the activity of specific gene copies, Sep\'ulveda et al. investigated the behavior of the lysogeny maintenance promoter of phage lambda in individual Escherichia coli cells. They measured the concentration of transcription factor and the actual number of mRNAs produced, and used mathematical modelling to discern the stochastic activity of the regulated promoter. The promoter underwent switching between configurations that occurred more rapidly than the lifetime of mRNA molecules produced, and individual copies of the same gene functioned independently in the same cell. Such studies can reveal new aspects of systems that have been well studied by more conventional techniques.
Science, this issue p. 1218
In vivo mapping of transcription-factor binding to the transcriptional output of the regulated gene is hindered by probabilistic promoter occupancy, the presence of multiple gene copies, and cell-to-cell variability. We demonstrate how to overcome these obstacles in the lysogeny maintenance promoter of bacteriophage lambda, PRM. We simultaneously measured the concentration of the lambda repressor CI and the number of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) from PRM in individual Escherichia coli cells, and used a theoretical model to identify the stochastic activity corresponding to different CI binding configurations. We found that switching between promoter configurations is faster than mRNA lifetime and that individual gene copies within the same cell act independently. The simultaneous quantification of transcription factor and promoter activity, followed by stochastic theoretical analysis, provides a tool that can be applied to other genetic circuits.
Precise quantitation reveals the properties of a phage gene promoter.

However, with the singular exception of the C. elegans microscale connectome, there are no complete connectivity data sets in other species. Here we report a brain-wide, cellular-level, mesoscale connectome for the mouse. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas uses enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing adeno-associated viral vectors to trace axonal projections from defined regions and cell types, and high-throughput serial two-photon tomography to image the EGFP-labelled axons throughout the brain. This systematic and standardized approach allows spatial registration of individual experiments into a common three dimensional (3D) reference space, resulting in a whole-brain connectivity matrix. A computational model yields insights into connectional strength distribution, symmetry and other network properties. Virtual tractography illustrates 3D topography among interconnected regions. Cortico-thalamic pathway analysis demonstrates segregation and integration of parallel pathways. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas is a freely available, foundational resource for structural and functional investigations into the neural circuits that support behavioural and cognitive processes in health and disease.},

The cell cycle, however, is a dynamic process whose subtle shifts are lost by fixed time-point methods. Live-cell fluorescent biosensors and time-lapse microscopy allows the collection of temporal information about real time cell cycle progression and arrest. Using two genetically-encoded biosensors, we measured the precision of the G1, S, G2 and M cell cycle phase durations in different cell types and identified a bimodal G1 phase duration in a fibroblast cell line that is not present in the other cell types. Using a cell line model for neuronal differentiation, we demonstrated that NGF-induced neurite extension occurs independently of NGF-induced cell cycle G1 phase arrest. Thus, we have begun to use cell cycle fluorescent biosensors to examine the proliferation of cell populations at the resolution of individual cells and neuronal differentiation as a dynamic process of parallel cell cycle arrest and neurite outgrowth.},

  abstract = {What happens in early, still undetectable human malignancies is unknown because direct observations are impractical. Here we present and validate a 'Big Bang' model, whereby tumors grow predominantly as a single expansion producing numerous intermixed subclones that are not subject to stringent selection and where both public (clonal) and most detectable private (subclonal) alterations arise early during growth. Genomic profiling of 349 individual glands from 15 colorectal tumors showed an absence of selective sweeps, uniformly high intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) and subclone mixing in distant regions, as postulated by our model. We also verified the prediction that most detectable ITH originates from early private alterations and not from later clonal expansions, thus exposing the profile of the primordial tumor. Moreover, some tumors appear 'born to be bad', with subclone mixing indicative of early malignant potential. This new model provides a quantitative framework to interpret tumor growth dynamics and the origins of ITH, with important clinical implications.},

  abstract = {In eukaryotes, the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C, also known as the cyclosome) regulates the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of specific cell-cycle proteins to coordinate chromosome segregation in mitosis and entry into the G1 phase. The catalytic activity of the APC/C and its ability to specify the destruction of particular proteins at different phases of the cell cycle are controlled by its interaction with two structurally related coactivator subunits, Cdc20 and Cdh1. Coactivators recognize substrate degrons, and enhance the affinity of the APC/C for its cognate E2 (refs 4, 5, 6). During mitosis, cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) and polo-like kinase (Plk) control Cdc20- and Cdh1-mediated activation of the APC/C. Hyperphosphorylation of APC/C subunits, notably Apc1 and Apc3, is required for Cdc20 to activate the APC/C, whereas phosphorylation of Cdh1 prevents its association with the APC/C. Since both coactivators associate with the APC/C through their common C-box and Ile-Arg tail motifs, the mechanism underlying this differential regulation is unclear, as is the role of specific APC/C phosphorylation sites. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical analysis, we define the molecular basis of how phosphorylation of human APC/C allows for its control by Cdc20. An auto-inhibitory segment of Apc1 acts as a molecular switch that in apo unphosphorylated APC/C interacts with the C-box binding site and obstructs engagement of Cdc20. Phosphorylation of the auto-inhibitory segment displaces it from the C-box-binding site. Efficient phosphorylation of the auto-inhibitory segment, and thus relief of auto-inhibition, requires the recruitment of Cdk\textendash{}cyclin in complex with a Cdk regulatory subunit (Cks) to a hyperphosphorylated loop of Apc3. We also find that the small-molecule inhibitor, tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester, preferentially suppresses APC/CCdc20 rather than APC/CCdh1, and interacts with the binding sites of both the C-box and Ile-Arg tail motifs. Our results reveal the mechanism for the regulation of mitotic APC/C by phosphorylation and provide a rationale for the development of selective inhibitors of this state.},

To explore TAD structure and function, we developed a polymer model that can extract the full repertoire of chromatin conformations within TADs from population-based 3C data. This model predicts actual physical distances and to what extent chromosomal contacts vary between cells. It also identifies interactions within single TADs that stabilize boundaries between TADs and allows us to identify and genetically validate key structural elements within TADs. Combining the model's predictions with high-resolution DNA FISH and quantitative RNA FISH for TADs within the X-inactivation center (Xic), we dissect the relationship between transcription and spatial proximity to cis-regulatory elements. We demonstrate that contacts between potential regulatory elements occur in the context of fluctuating structures rather than stable loops and propose that such fluctuations may contribute to asymmetric expression in the Xic during X inactivation.},

In this work, we focus on translational and reporter maturation delay, reporting that its introduction into the two-stage model reduces the cross correlation between instantaneous mRNA and protein levels. Our results indicate that the experimentally observed sample correlation coefficient between mRNA and protein levels may increase if the protein measurements are shifted back in time by the value of the delay.},

At high expression levels, the distributions are dominated by extrinsic noise. We found that a single cell's protein and mRNA copy numbers for any given gene are uncorrelated.

  volume = {104},
  issn = {0003-0147},
  abstract = {It is shown in this paper that no stable equilibrium can be attained in an ecological community in which some r of the components are limited by less than r limiting factors. The limiting factors are thus put forward as those aspects of the niche crucial in the determination of whether species can coexist. For example, consider the following simple food web: Despite the similar positions occupied by the two prey species in this web, it is possible for them to coexist if each is limited by an independent combination of predation and resource limitation, since then two independent factors are serving to limit two species. On the other hand, if two species feed on distinct but superabundant food sources, but are limited by the same single predator, they cannot continue to coexist indefinitely. Thus these two species, although apparently filling distinct ecological niches, cannot survive together. In general, each species will increase if the predator becomes scarce, will decrease where it is abundant, and will have a characteristic threshold predator level at which it stabilizes. That species with the higher threshold level will be on the increase when the other is not, and will tend to replace the other in the community. If the two have comparable threshold values, which is certainly possible, any equilibrium reached between the two will be highly variable, and no stable equilibrium situation will result. This is not the same as dismissing this situation as "infinitely unlikely," which is not an acceptable argument in this case. Hutchinson's point of the preceding section vividly illustrates this. The results of this paper improve on existing results in three ways. First, they eliminate the restriction that all species are resource-limited, a restriction persistent in the literature. Second, the results relate in general to periodic equilibria rather than to constant equilibria. Third, the nature of the proof relates to the crucial question of the behavior of trajectories near the proposed equilibrium, and provides insight into the behavior of the system when there is an insufficient number of limiting factors.},

Here, we focus instead on cell surface area to volume ratio (SA/V) and demonstrate that SA/V homeostasis underlies size determination. We propose a model whereby the instantaneous rates of surface and volume synthesis both scale with volume. This model predicts that these relative rates dictate SA/V and that cells approach a new steady-state SA/V exponentially, with a decay constant equal to the volume growth rate. To test this, we exposed diverse bacterial species to sublethal concentrations of a cell wall biosynthesis inhibitor and observed dose-dependent decreases in SA/V. Furthermore, this decrease was exponential and had the expected decay constant. The model also quantitatively describes SA/V alterations induced by other chemical, nutritional, and genetic perturbations. We additionally present evidence for a surface~material accumulation threshold underlying division, sensitizing cell length to changes in SA/V requirements.},

From a careful analysis of a large volume of the protein trajectories obtained over a wide range of sampling rates and long durations, we find that the normalized histogram of the protein displacements shows an exponential tail, which is robust and universal for cells under different conditions.

  abstract = {Mating type in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is determined by two nonhomologous alleles, MATa and MAT$\alpha$. These sequences encode regulators of the two different haploid mating types and of the diploids formed by their conjugation. Analysis of the MATa1, MAT$\alpha$1, and MAT$\alpha$2 alleles provided one of the earliest models of cell-type specification by transcriptional activators and repressors. Remarkably, homothallic yeast cells can switch their mating type as often as every generation by a highly choreographed, site-specific homologous recombination event that replaces one MAT allele with different DNA sequences encoding the opposite MAT allele. This replacement process involves the participation of two intact but unexpressed copies of mating-type information at the heterochromatic loci, HML$\alpha$ and HMRa, which are located at opposite ends of the same chromosome-encoding MAT. The study of MAT switching has yielded important insights into the control of cell lineage, the silencing of gene expression, the formation of heterochromatin, and the regulation of accessibility of the donor sequences. Real-time analysis of MAT switching has provided the most detailed description of the molecular events that occur during the homologous recombinational repair of a programmed double-strand chromosome break.},

MATa preferentially recombines with HML near the left telomere of chromosome III, whereas MAT$\alpha$ prefers HMR near the right telomere.

To test if HML is constrained in pairing with MAT$\alpha$, we examined live-cell mobility of LacI-GFP\textendash{}bound lactose operator (lacO) arrays inserted at different chromosomal sites. Without induction of recombination, lacO sequences adjacent to HML are strongly constrained in both MAT$\alpha$ and RE-deleted MATa strains, compared with MATa. In contrast, chromosome movement at HMR or near a telomere of chromosome V is mating-type independent. HML is more constrained in MATa $\Delta$re and less constrained in MATa RE+ compared with other sites. Although HML and MATa are not prealigned before inducing recombination, the three-dimensional configuration of MAT, HML, and HMR is mating-type dependent. These data suggest there is constitutive tethering of HML, which is relieved in MATa cells through the action of RE.},

  abstract = {Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells switch mating type by replacing genetic information at the expressed mat1 locus with sequences copied from mat2-P or mat3-M silent donor loci. The choice of donor locus is dictated by cell type, such that mat2 is the preferred donor in M cells and mat3 is the preferred donor in P cells. Donor choice involves a recombination-promoting complex (RPC) containing Swi2 and Swi5. In P cells, the RPC localizes to a specific DNA element located adjacent to mat3, but in M cells it spreads across the silent mating-type region, including mat2-P. This differential distribution of the RPC regulates nonrandom choice of donors. However, cell-type\textendash{}specific differences in RPC localization are not understood. Here we show that the mat1-M\textendash{}encoded factor Mc, which shares structural and functional similarities with the male sex-determining factor SRY, is highly enriched at the swi2 and swi5 loci and promotes elevated levels of RPC components. Loss of Mc reduces Swi2 and Swi5 to levels comparable to those in P cells and disrupts RPC spreading across the mat2/3 region. Mc also localizes to loci expressed preferentially in M cells and to retrotransposon LTRs. We demonstrate that Mc localization at LTRs and at swi2 requires Abp1, a homolog of transposon-derived CENP-B protein and that loss of Abp1 impairs Swi2 protein expression and the donor choice mechanism. These results suggest that Mc modulates levels of recombination factors, which is important for mating-type donor selection and for the biased gene conversion observed during meiosis, where M cells serve as preferential donors of genetic information.},

The mat1 switching occurs by replacing mat1 with a copy derived from a silenced ``donor locus,'' mat2P or mat3M. The mechanism of donor choice ensuring that switching occurs primarily and productively to the opposite type, called directionality, is largely unknown. Here we identified the mat1-Mc gene, a mammalian sex-determination gene (SRY) homolog, as the primary gene that dictates directionality in M cells. A previously unrecognized, shorter swi2 mRNA, a truncated form of the swi2, was identified, and its expression requires the mat1-Mc function. We also found that the abp1 gene (human CENPB homolog) controls directionality through swi2 regulation. In addition, we implicated a cis-acting DNA sequence in mat2 utilization. Overall, we showed that switching directionality is controlled by judicious expression of two swi2 transcripts through a cell-type-regulated dual promoter. In this respect, this regulation mechanism resembles that of the Drosophila sex-determination Slx gene.},

By directly measuring chromosome compaction in living cells of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we found an additional role for the meiotic cohesin in the compaction of chromosomes during meiotic prophase. In the absence of Rec8, chromosomes were decompacted relative to those of wild-type cells. Conversely, loss of the cohesin-associated protein Pds5 resulted in hypercompaction. Although this hypercompaction requires Rec8, binding of Rec8 to chromatin was reduced in the absence of Pds5, indicating that Pds5 promotes chromosome association of Rec8. To explain these observations, we propose that meiotic prophase chromosomes are organized as chromatin loops emanating from a Rec8-containing axis: the absence of Rec8 disrupts the axis, resulting in disorganized chromosomes, whereas reduced Rec8 loading results in a longitudinally compacted axis with fewer attachment points and longer chromatin loops.},

The region between these sites (K region) is inert for meiotic crossing over. The mating-type genes (M or P) are expressed only when present at a third, active locus (mat1). We have earlier shown that the positional regulation of P genes is based on repression at the silent site, caused by elements in the flanking DNA sequences. In this study we have mutagenized a sterile mat1 deleted strain and selected for cells that are able to conjugate. Recessive mutations of this type should define genes encoding trans-acting factors involved in repression of the silent mating-type loci. Before this work mutations in two genes, clr1 and swi6, had been shown to allow both expression of the silent loci and recombination in the K region. The sensitivity of the present selection is demonstrated by the isolation of new mutations that derepress one or both of the silent loci (M-mating or bi-mating). The frequency of M-mating mutants was almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of bi-mating mutants and in all mutants analyzed mat3-M expression was significantly higher than mat2-P expression. The mutations define three new genes, clr2, clr3 and clr4. In addition we show that the rik1 mutant previously known to allow recombination in the K region also depresses the silent loci.},

Gene replacement showed that swi6 is not essential for viability. The Swi6 protein is very hydrophilic; it contains 41\% charged aa. A region of 48 aa is homologous to a sequence motif found in the chromatin-associated proteins, HP1 and Polycomb (Drosophila melanogaster), M31, M32 and M33 (mouse), and the human HSM1 protein. This motif is called chromo domain (chromatin organization modifier). Our results indicate that Swi6 is a structural component of chromatin.

Location of the mat1 "hot spot" for transposition should be contrasted with the "cold spot" of meiotic recombination located within the adjoining mat2-mat3 interval. That is, meiotic interchromosomal recombination in mat2, mat3 and the intervening 15-kilobase region does not occur at all. swi2 and swi6 switching-deficient mutants possess the normal level of double-strand break at mat1, yet they fail to switch efficiently. By testing for meiotic recombination in the cold spot, we found the usual lack of recombination in a swi2 mutant but a significant level of recombination in a swi6 mutant. Therefore, the swi6 gene function is required to keep the donor loci inert for interchromosomal recombination. This finding, combined with the additional result that switching primarily occurs intrachromosomally, suggests that the donor loci are made accessible for switching by folding them onto mat1, thus causing the cold spot of recombination.},

Genomic DNA is the repository of all genetic information and is packaged into chromatin. Chromatin is also a repository of regulatory information in the form of covalent marks added to the histones that package the DNA. These marks can determine tissue- and organ-specific gene expression patterns, which must be transmitted to daughter cells to maintain their identity. Ragunathan et al. and Audergon et al. show that in fission yeast, a chromatin mark, like genetic information, can be inherited across many cell generations. The mark can be inherited independently of DNA sequence, DNA methylation, or RNA interference. Thus, histone marks constitute true epigenetic information.
Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1258699; see also p. 132
Posttranslational histone modifications are believed to allow the epigenetic transmission of distinct chromatin states, independently of associated DNA sequences. Histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation is essential for heterochromatin formation; however, a demonstration of its epigenetic heritability is lacking. Fission yeast has a single H3K9 methyltransferase, Clr4, that directs all H3K9 methylation and heterochromatin. Using releasable tethered Clr4 reveals that an active process rapidly erases H3K9 methylation from tethering sites in wild-type cells. However, inactivation of the putative histone demethylase Epe1 allows H3K9 methylation and silent chromatin maintenance at the tethering site through many mitotic divisions, and transgenerationally through meiosis, after release of tethered Clr4. Thus, H3K9 methylation is a heritable epigenetic mark whose transmission is usually countered by its active removal, which prevents the unauthorized inheritance of heterochromatin.
Covalent histone modifications are inherited epigenetically across many generations.

  abstract = {The motion of chromosomal DNA is essential to many biological processes, including segregation, transcriptional regulation, recombination, and packaging. Physical understanding of these processes would be dramatically enhanced through predictive, quantitative modeling of chromosome dynamics of multiple loci. Using a polymer dynamics framework, we develop a~prediction for the correlation in the velocities of two loci on a single chromosome or otherwise connected by chromatin. These predictions reveal that the signature of correlated motion between two loci can be identified by varying the lag time between locus position measurements. In general, this theory predicts that as the lag time interval increases, the dual-loci dynamic behavior transitions from being completely uncorrelated to behaving as an effective single locus. This transition corresponds to the timescale of the stress communication between loci through the intervening segment. This relatively simple framework makes quantitative predictions based on a single timescale fit parameter that can be directly compared to the in~vivo motion of fluorescently labeled chromosome loci. Furthermore, this theoretical framework enables the detection of dynamically coupled chromosome regions from the signature of their correlated motion.},

  abstract = {DNA looping plays a key role in many fundamental biological processes, including gene regulation, recombination, and chromosomal organization. The looping of DNA is often mediated by proteins whose structural features and physical interactions can alter the length scale at which the looping occurs. Looping and unlooping processes are controlled by thermodynamic contributions associated with mechanical deformation of the DNA strand and entropy arising from thermal fluctuations of the conformation. To determine how these confounding effects influence DNA looping and unlooping kinetics, we present a theoretical model that incorporates the role of the protein interactions, DNA mechanics, and conformational entropy. We show that for shorter DNA strands the interaction distance affects the transition state, resulting in a complex relationship between the looped and unlooped state lifetimes and the physical properties of the looped DNA. We explore the range of behaviors that arise with varying interaction distance and DNA length. These results demonstrate how DNA deformation and entropy dictate the scaling of the looping and unlooping kinetics versus the J-factor, establishing the connection between kinetic and equilibrium behaviors. Our results show how the twist-and-bend elasticity of the DNA chain modulates the kinetics and how the influence of the interaction distance fades away at intermediate to longer chain lengths, in agreement with previous scaling predictions.},

  abstract = {Describing the kinetics of polymer reactions, such as the formation of loops and hairpins in nucleic acids or polypeptides, is complicated by the structural dynamics of their chains. Although both intramolecular reactions, such as cyclization, and intermolecular reactions have been studied extensively, both experimentally and theoretically, there is to date no exact explicit analytical treatment of transport-limited polymer reaction kinetics, even in the case of the simplest (Rouse) model of monomers connected by linear springs. We introduce a new analytical approach to calculate the mean reaction time of polymer reactions that encompasses the non-Markovian dynamics of monomer motion. This requires that the conformational statistics of the polymer at the very instant of reaction be determined, which provides, as a by-product, new information on the reaction path. We show that the typical reactive conformation of the polymer is more extended than the equilibrium conformation, which leads to reaction times significantly shorter than predicted by the existing classical Markovian theory.

  abstract = {The first-passage time, defined as the time a random walker takes to reach a target point in a confining domain, is a key quantity in the theory of stochastic processes. Its importance comes from its crucial role in quantifying the efficiency of processes as varied as diffusion-limited reactions, target search processes or the spread of diseases. Most methods of determining the properties of first-passage time in confined domains have been limited to Markovian (memoryless) processes. However, as soon as the random walker interacts with its environment, memory effects cannot be neglected: that is, the future motion of the random walker does not depend only on its current position, but also on its past trajectory. Examples of non-Markovian dynamics include single-file diffusion in narrow channels, or the motion of a tracer particle either attached to a polymeric chain or diffusing in simple or complex fluids such as nematics, dense soft colloids or viscoelastic solutions. Here we introduce an analytical approach to calculate, in the limit of a large confining volume, the mean first-passage time of a Gaussian non-Markovian random walker to a target. The non-Markovian features of the dynamics are encompassed by determining the statistical properties of the fictitious trajectory that the random walker would follow after the first-passage event takes place, which are shown to govern the first-passage time kinetics. This analysis is applicable to a broad range of stochastic processes, which may be correlated at long times. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations for several examples of non-Markovian processes, including the case of fractional Brownian motion in one and higher dimensions. These results reveal, on the basis of Gaussian processes, the importance of memory effects in first-passage statistics of non-Markovian random walkers in confinement.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to investigate several analytical methods of solving first passage (FP) problem for the Rouse model, a simplest model of a polymer chain. We show that this problem has to be treated as a multi-dimensional Kramers' problem, which presents rich and unexpected behavior. We first perform direct and forward-flux sampling (FFS) simulations and measure the mean first-passage time $\tau$(z) for the free end to reach a certain distance z away from the origin. The results show that the mean FP time is getting faster if the Rouse chain is represented by more beads. Two scaling regimes of $\tau$(z) are observed, with transition between them varying as a function of chain length. We use these simulation results to test two theoretical approaches. One is a well known asymptotic theory valid in the limit of zero temperature. We show that this limit corresponds to fully extended chain when each chain segment is stretched, which is not particularly realistic. A new theory based on the well known Freidlin-Wentzell theory is proposed, where dynamics is projected onto the minimal action path. The new theory predicts both scaling regimes correctly, but fails to get the correct numerical prefactor in the first regime. Combining our theory with the FFS simulations leads us to a simple analytical expression valid for all extensions and chain lengths. One of the applications of polymer FP problem occurs in the context of branched polymer rheology. In this paper, we consider the arm-retraction mechanism in the tube model, which maps exactly on the model we have solved. The results are compared to the Milner-McLeish theory without constraint release, which is found to overestimate FP time by a factor of 10 or more.},

The theory is based on the preceding paper by Fixman, with the adoption of a smoothed excluded-volume potential and the following first-order approximation to the operator L which determines the segment coordinate distribution function $\psi$; for L acting on the nonequilibrium part of $\psi$, only the diagonal part of L in the free-draining basis representation is used. This corresponds qualitatively to the Zimm theory in Hearst\&apos;s version. However, the avoidance of preaveraging the Oseen hydrodynamic interaction tensor in the present work leads to larger values for the relaxation times of various normal modes when the hydrodynamic shielding effect is not negligible. The effect is more pronounced for lower modes, amounting to about eight percent increase in the lowest mode excited by the velocity gradient in the nondraining limit. The value of [$\eta$] in the same limit is found to be [$\eta$]=2.68\texttimes{}1023 L 3/Mw (L: the root-mean-square end-to-end distance, Mw : the molecular weight of the polymer; cgs units) and is about 5\% lower than that obtained by the Zimm treatment.

  abstract = {Spatial ordering of macromolecular components inside cells is important for cellular physiology and replication. In bacteria, ParA/B systems are known to generate various intracellular patterns that underlie the transport and partitioning of low-copy-number cargos such as plasmids. ParA/B systems consist of ParA, an ATPase that dimerizes and binds DNA upon ATP binding, and ParB, a protein that binds the cargo and stimulates ParA ATPase activity. Inside cells, ParA is asymmetrically distributed, forming a propagating wave that is followed by the ParB-rich cargo. These correlated dynamics lead to cargo oscillation or equidistant spacing over the nucleoid depending on whether the cargo is in single or multiple copies. Currently, there is no model that explains how these different spatial patterns arise and relate to each other. Here, we test a simple DNA-relay model that has no imposed asymmetry and that only considers the ParA/ParB biochemistry and the known fluctuating and elastic dynamics of chromosomal loci. Stochastic simulations with experimentally derived parameters demonstrate that this model is sufficient to reproduce the signature patterns of ParA/B systems: the propagating ParA gradient correlated with the cargo dynamics, the single-cargo oscillatory motion, and the multicargo equidistant patterning. Stochasticity of ATP hydrolysis breaks the initial symmetry in ParA distribution, resulting in imbalance of elastic force acting on the cargo. Our results may apply beyond ParA/B systems as they reveal how a minimal system of two players, one binding to DNA and the other modulating this binding, can transform directionally random DNA fluctuations into directed motion and intracellular patterning.},

The most common system that mediates plasmid DNA inheritance in bacteria is through a parABC locus, encoding proteins ParA and ParB, and DNA sequence parC. These components can position plasmids at equally spaced positions throughout a cell to ensure plasmids are present in both daughter cells when the cell divides into two. Here we study the mechanism by which ParA structures achieve this precise positioning. We show that ParA can direct relatively immobile plasmids over the bacterial chromosome using self-organizing, competitive ParA structures, whose disassembly is induced by plasmid parC-bound ParB. More generally these findings will help us to understand transport and regular positioning of intracellular cargo.},

ATPases of this class interact with DNA non-specifically in vitro and colocalize with the bacterial nucleoid to generate a variety of reported patterns in vivo. Here, we directly visualize ParA binding to DNA using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. This activity depends on, and is highly specific for ATP. DNA-binding activity is not coupled to ATP hydrolysis. Rather, ParA undergoes a slow multi-step conformational transition upon ATP binding, which licenses ParA to bind non-specific DNA. The kinetics provide a time-delay switch to allow slow cycling between the DNA binding and non-binding forms of ParA. We propose that this time delay, combined with stimulation of ParA's ATPase activity by ParB bound to the plasmid DNA, generates an uneven distribution of the nucleoid-associated ParA, and provides the motive force for plasmid segregation prior to cell division.},

Bacteria use a set of DNA-binding proteins with low sequence specificity called nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) to assist in chromosome condensation and organization. By bending or bridging DNA, NAPs also facilitate chromosome segregation and regulate gene expression. Over the past decade, emerging single-molecule and chromosome conformation capture techniques have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which NAPs remodel and organize the bacterial chromosome. In this review we describe how such approaches reveal the biochemical mechanisms of three NAPs that are believed to facilitate DNA bridging: histone-like nucleoid structuring protein (H-NS), ParB, and structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC). These three proteins form qualitatively different DNA bridges, leading to varied effects on transcription and chromosome segregation.},

In this paper, we introduced site-specific DSBs in Caulobacter crescentus and then used time-lapse microscopy to visualize the ensuing chromosome dynamics. Damaged loci rapidly mobilized after a DSB, pairing with their homologous partner to enable repair, before being resegregated to their original cellular locations, independent of DNA replication. Origin-proximal regions were resegregated by the ParABS system with the ParA structure needed for resegregation assembling dynamically in response to the DSB-induced movement of an origin-associated ParB away from one cell pole. Origin-distal regions were resegregated in a ParABS-independent manner and instead likely rely on a physical, spring-like force to segregate repaired loci. Collectively, our results provide a mechanistic basis for the resegregation of chromosomes after a DSB.},

  abstract = {In bacteria, ParABS systems mediate intracellular transport of various cargos, including chromosomal regions in Caulobacter crescentus. Transport of the ParB/parS partition complex requires the DNA-binding activity of ParA, which transiently tethers the partition complex during translocation. In C.~crescentus, the directionality of the transport is set up by a gradient of ParA whose concentration gradually increases from one end of the cell (old pole) to the other (new pole). Importantly, this ParA gradient is already observed before DNA replication and segregation are initiated when the partition complex is anchored at the old pole. How such micron-scale ParA pattern is established and maintained before the initiation of chromosome segregation has not been experimentally established. Although the stimulation of ParA ATPase activity by the localized ParB/parS partition complex is thought to be involved, this activity alone cannot quantitatively describe the ParA pattern observed inside cells. Instead, our experimental and theoretical study shows that the missing key component for achieving the experimentally observed steady-state ParA patterning is the slow mobility of ParA dimers (D $\sim$10-3 $\mu$m2/s) due to intermittent DNA binding. Our model recapitulates the entire steady-state ParA distribution observed experimentally, including the shape of the gradient as well as ParA accumulation at the location of the partition complex. Stochastic simulations suggest that cell-to-cell variability in ParA pattern is due to the low ParA copy number in C.~crescentus cells. The model also accounts for an apparent exclusion of ParA from regions with small spacing between partition complexes observed in filamentous cells. Collectively, our work demonstrates that in addition to its function in mediating transport, the conserved DNA-binding property of ParA has a critical function before DNA segregation by setting up a ParA pattern required for transport directionality.},

  abstract = {Author Summary Reliable chromosome segregation is crucial to all dividing cells. In some bacteria, segregation has been found to occur in a rather counterintuitive way: the chromosome attaches to a filament bundle and erodes it by causing depolymerization of the filaments. Moreover, unlike eukaryotic cells, bacteria do not use molecular motors and/or macromolecular tethers to position their chromosomes. This raises the general question of how depolymerizing filaments alone can continuously and robustly pull cargo as the filaments themselves are falling apart. In this work, we introduce the first quantitative physical model for depolymerization-driven translocation in a many-filament system. Our simulations of this model suggest a novel underlying mechanism for robust translocation, namely self-diffusiophoresis, motion of an object in a self-generated concentration gradient in a viscous environment. In this case, the cargo generates and sustains a concentration gradient of filaments by inducing them to depolymerize. We demonstrate that our model agrees well with existing experimental observations such as segregation failure, filament-length-dependent translocation velocity, and chromosomal compaction. In addition, we make several predictions\textendash{}including predictions for the specific modes by which the chromosome binds to the filament structure and triggers its disassembly\textendash{}that can be tested experimentally.},

The small size of bacteria along with the number of physical and biochemical processes involved in subcellular organization makes it difficult to study these systems under controlled conditions in vivo. We developed a cell-free reconstitution technique that allows for the visualization of ParA-mediated cargo transport on a DNA carpet, which acts as a biomimetic of the nucleoid surface. Here, we present methods to express, purify, and visualize the dynamic properties of the SopABC system from F plasmid, considered a paradigm for the study of ParA-type systems.

In these experiments, a magnetic bead was covered with the protein ParB and was able to move ballistically over a surface of DNA that was bound by the protein ParA. How does this active transport spontaneously emerge? In this paper we present a deterministic model for the dynamics of ParA-ParB proteins. We show how spatial noise in surface bound ParA is sufficient for the creation of a gradient in ParA that can drive motion of ParB in vitro. The model explains certain key aspects of the in vitro ParA-ParB system and leads to testable predictions.},

  abstract = {Until recently, a dedicated mitotic apparatus that segregates newly replicated chromosomes into daughter cells was believed to be unique to eukaryotic cells. Here we demonstrate that the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus segregates its chromosome using a partitioning (Par) apparatus that has surprising similarities to eukaryotic spindles. We show that the C. crescentus ATPase ParA forms linear polymers in vitro and assembles into a narrow linear structure in vivo. The centromere-binding protein ParB binds to and destabilizes ParA structures in vitro. We propose that this ParB-stimulated ParA depolymerization activity moves the centromere to the opposite cell pole through a burnt bridge Brownian ratchet mechanism. Finally, we identify the pole-specific TipN protein as a new component of the Par system that is required to maintain the directionality of DNA transfer towards the new cell pole. Our results elucidate a bacterial chromosome segregation mechanism that features basic operating principles similar to eukaryotic mitotic machines, including a multivalent protein complex at the centromere that stimulates the dynamic disassembly of polymers to move chromosomes into daughter compartments.},

Fluorescence nanoscopy, or super-resolution microscopy, has become an important tool in cell biological research. However, because of its usually inferior resolution in the depth direction (50\textendash{}80~nm) and rapidly deteriorating resolution in thick samples, its practical biological application has been effectively limited to two dimensions and thin samples. Here, we present the development of whole-cell 4Pi single-molecule switching nanoscopy (W-4PiSMSN), an optical nanoscope that allows imaging of three-dimensional (3D) structures at 10- to 20-nm resolution throughout entire mammalian cells. We demonstrate the wide applicability of W-4PiSMSN across diverse research fields by imaging complex molecular architectures ranging from bacteriophages to nuclear pores, cilia, and synaptonemal complexes in large 3D cellular volumes.},

We use high-resolution atomic force microscopy on individual DNA molecules to obtain a direct measurement of the bending energy function appropriate for scales down to 5 nm. Our measurements imply that the elastic energy of highly bent DNA conformations is lower than predicted by classical elasticity models such as the worm-like chain (WLC) model. For example, we found that on short length scales, spontaneous large-angle bends are many times more prevalent than predicted by the WLC model. We test our data and model with an interlocking set of consistency checks. Our analysis also shows how our model is compatible with previous experiments, which have sometimes been viewed as confirming the WLC.},

  abstract = {A semiflexible polymer chain shows characteristic local chain persistency and finite extensibility. Confinement of such a polymer introduces a confinement length scale that competes with the persistence length. This review describes the basic theoretical formalism for a single wormlike chain in an external confinement potential field and for confined wormlike chains that interact with each other through a potential energy depending on both orientational and positional variables. We present a summary of the current understanding in formulating a calculation for the free energy through a single-chain Green's function theory and multi-chain self-consistent field theory, and in specifying appropriate confinement boundary conditions. The wormlike-chain formalism has the capability to capture physical features in a length scale smaller than the persistence length and in a length scale comparable to the total chain length. It also builds the orientational dependence in the foundation of the formalism, that can be used to describe the coupled orientational and positional dependencies of many polymer problems. It has the advantage over a typical Gaussian-chain formalism for description of the physical properties where these features are the main concerns. However, the mathematical treatment of a wormlike-chain model is much more complicated than that of a Gaussian-chain model, due to the coupling between the orientational and positional degrees of freedom. It is this coupling that gives rise to physical features that are unique in semiflexible-chain systems. Example applications of the theoretical framework are also described here, on calculating the free energy and conformational properties of a confined long wormlike chain, on describing the orientational defect structures of confined liquid crystals, and on demonstrating the orientation-induced surface wetting phenomenon.},

  abstract = {The details surrounding the crossover from wormlike-specific to universal polymeric behavior has been the subject of debate and confusion even for the simple case of a dilute, unconfined wormlike chain. We have directly computed the polymer size, form factor, free energy, and Kirkwood diffusivity for unconfined wormlike chains as a function of molecular weight, focusing on persistence lengths and effective widths that represent single-stranded and double-stranded DNA in a high ionic strength buffer. To do so, we use a chain-growth Monte Carlo algorithm, the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM), which allows us to estimate equilibrium and near-equilibrium dynamic properties of wormlike chains over an extremely large range of contour lengths. From our calculations, we find that very large DNA chains ($\approx$1\,000\,000, base pairs depending on the choice of size metric) are required to reach flexible, swollen nondraining coils. Furthermore, our results indicate that the commonly used model polymer $\lambda$-DNA (48\,500, base pairs) does not exhibit ``ideal'' scaling but exists in the middle of the transition to long-chain behavior. We subsequently conclude that typical DNA used in experiments are too short to serve as an accurate model of long-chain, universal polymer behavior.},

  title = {Physical {{Modeling}} of {{Particle}} and {{Chromosome Dynamics}} in {{Living Cells}}},
  abstract = {The cellular cytoplasm is a complex, viscoelastic medium whose properties result in a
rich, non-trivial spectrum of transport behaviors for the biomolecules diffusing within
it. While much is known of the biochemistry of these biomolecules, their motion and
organization has only just started to be understood due to advances in fluorescence
microscopy in the last few decades. The disruption of this organization can lead to
a wide variety of disease states or even the death of the cell. Thus a fundamental
physical understanding of these effects could guide novel strategies for the treatment
of infection and disease. Our work develops physical models to better predict the
consequences of the intracellular medium on biomolecular motion and interpret the
results from particle tracking data of RNA-protein particles and chromosome loci in
living cells.
One of the key attributes of the cytoplasm is the high degree of macromolecular
crowding that results in nontrivial transport behaviors. Objects in crowded media
generally exhibit slower rates of diffusion relative to being in pure water, and often ex-
hibit viscoelastic behavior for a broad range of timescales. We examine datasets track-
ing RNA-protein particles in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces
cerevisaie, which show viscoelastic, subdiffusive behavior. We find that these particles
exhibit non-Gaussian displacement distributions in apparent violation of the central
ivlimit theorem and classical diffusion equation. We use a relatively simple framework
to show that this non-Gaussian behavior is primarily due to a broad distribution of
diffusion coefficients between particles in different cells. To gain a better physical
understanding, of these nontrivial behaviors, we use Brownian dynamics simulations
to identify the signatures that are a consequence of crowding in a confinement. We
show that crowding alone between particles with hard-core repulsion is sufficient to
cause subdiffusive, viscoelastic behavior over a broad range of timescales.
Inside each cell are long molecules of DNA which are the main carrier of hereditary
information passed on to daughter cells. This DNA when complexed with proteins
is called chromatin, which exhibits a complex heterogeneous structure that enables
a layer of control over what genetic information is accessible at any given time. The
chromatin must be stable enough to maintain specific cell states and ensure control
of gene expression, yet dynamic and malleable enough to undergo large scale reor-
ganization when necessary for processes such as segregation and loop formation. A
basic theory and understanding of the motion of single chromosome locus modeled
as a polymer in a viscoelastic medium has been previously developed. Continuing on
from this framework, we find that the inclusion of a biasing force on a single polymer
segment is able to accurately describe the directed motion of a locus at the start
of chromosome segregation in bacteria. Recently, experimentalists tracked pairs of
chromosome loci in living cells, but there was not yet a comprehensive theory for
interpreting the motion of two tracked loci relative to one another. Toward this goal,
we develop a theory extending the model for a polymer in a viscoelastic medium to
predict the evolution in the velocity correlations between two dynamically coupled
loci and estimate their stress communication timescale.},

  abstract = {Ever since the pioneering work of Minton, it has been recognized that the highly crowded interior of biological cells has the potential to cause dramatic changes to both the kinetics and thermodynamics of protein folding and association events relative to behavior that might be observed in dilute solution conditions. One very productive way to explore the effects of crowding on protein behavior has been to use macromolecular crowding agents that exclude volume without otherwise strongly interacting with the protein under study. An alternative, complementary approach to understanding the potential differences between behavior in vivo and in vitro is to develop simulation models that explicitly attempt to model intracellular environments at the molecular scale, and that thereby can be used to directly monitor biophysical behavior in conditions that accurately mimic those encountered in vivo. It is with studies of this type that the present review will be concerned. We review in detail four published studies that have attempted to simulate the structure and dynamics of the bacterial cytoplasm and that have each explored different biophysical aspects of the cellular interior. While each of these studies has yielded important new insights, there are important questions that remain to be resolved in terms of determining the relative contributions made by energetic and hydrodynamic interactions to the diffusive behavior of macromolecules and to the thermodynamics of protein folding and associations in vivo. Some possible new directions for future generation simulation models of the cytoplasm are outlined.},

The data resulting from our implementation of this method is consistent with the scaling of the squared radius of gyration of random walks, with no thickness constraint. Based on this, we use the data to describe the complex relationship between the presence and nature of knotting and size, thickness and shape of the random walk. We extend the current understanding of excluded volume by expanding the range of analysis of how the squared radius of gyration scales with length and thickness. We also examine the profound effect of thickness on knotting in open chains. We will quantify how thickness effects the size of thick open chains, calculating the growth exponent for squared radius of gyration as a function of thickness. We will also show that for radius \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/1751-8121/49/13/135203/jpaaa1316ieqn2.gif] \$r$\backslash$leqslant 0.4\$ , increasing thickness by 0.1 decreases the probability of knot formation by 50\% or more.},

Extensive BD simulations were performed to calculate the diffusion coefficients of three different proteins in the cellular environment. The results are in close agreement with experimental or previously simulated values, where available. Control simulations without HI showed that use of HI is essential to obtain accurate diffusion coefficients. Anomalous diffusion inside the crowded cellular medium was investigated with Fractional Brownian motion analysis, and found to be present in this model. By running a series of control simulations in which various forces were removed systematically, it was found that repulsive interactions (volume exclusion) are the main cause for anomalous diffusion, with a secondary contribution from HI.},

  abstract = {Author Summary The interior of a typical bacterial cell is a highly crowded place in which molecules must jostle and compete with each other in order to carry out their biological functions. The conditions under which such molecules are typically studied in vitro, however, are usually quite different: one or a few different types of molecules are studied as they freely diffuse in a dilute, aqueous solution. There is therefore a significant disconnect between the conditions under which molecules can be most usefully studied and the conditions under which such molecules usually ``live'', and developing ways to bridge this gap is likely to be important for properly understanding molecular behavior in vivo. Toward this end, we show in this work that computer simulations can be used to model the interior of bacterial cells at a near atomic level of detail: the rates of diffusion of proteins are matched to known experimental values, and their thermodynamic stabilities are found to be in good agreement with the few measurements that have so far been performed in vivo. While the simulation approach is certainly not free of assumptions, it offers a potentially important complement to experimental techniques and provides a vivid illustration of molecular behavior inside a biological cell that is likely to be of significant educational value.},

  abstract = {This paper presents new applications of the McMillan-Mayer solution theory to dispersions of highly charged colloidal cylinders in monovalent salt solutions. The thermodynamic solution properties are given in terms of the virial expansions relating to a Donnan membrane equilibrium. General expressions are derived for the second Donnan pressure virial coefficient B2 and for the first two salt distribution coefficients A1 and A2. The effect of electric interactions is represented as an increased effective diameter dB or dA of the colloidal cylinder. This yields the simple excluded volume expressions B2 = $\pi$dBL2/4 and A1 = $\pi$dA2L/4 for hard cylinders of length L and diameter dB and dA, respectively. The coefficient A2 is derived from the dependence of B2 on the salt concentration. Computations are made for double-stranded DNA in sodium chloride solutions with the DNA model developed in the preceding paper: a uniformly charged cylinder, with size and charge consistent with transport experiments, and surrounded by a Gouy double layer. In 1\textendash{}0.005M sodium chloride solutions dB is found to vary from 29 \AA{} to about 220 \AA, and dA from 30 \AA{} to about 170 \AA, with little sensitivity to the uncertainties in the kinetic diameter d $\approx$ 24 \AA{} and the experimental $\zeta$ potentials of DNA. Corresponding results predicted by the classical Donnan theory are 6\textendash{}167 times too high for B2. Values of A2 are relatively small, in line with the expected rapid convergence of the virial expansion for the salt distribution. This is consistent with a phase transition from random to parallel orientation of the cylinders predicted first by Onsager for hard cylinders on the basis of B2, but not yet observed for DNA in simple salt solutions.},

  abstract = {The conformation and dynamics of circular polymers is a subject of considerable theoretical and experimental interest. DNA is an important example because it occurs naturally in different topological states, including linear, relaxed circular, and supercoiled circular forms. A fundamental question is how the diffusion coefficients of isolated polymers scale with molecular length and how they vary for different topologies. Here, diffusion coefficients D for relaxed circular, supercoiled, and linear DNA molecules of length L ranging from $\approx$6 to 290 kbp were measured by tracking the Brownian motion of single molecules. A topology-independent scaling law D $\sim$ L -$\nu$ was observed with $\nu$L = 0.571 $\pm$ 0.014, $\nu$C = 0.589 $\pm$ 0.018, and $\nu$S = 0.571 $\pm$ 0.057 for linear, relaxed circular, and supercoiled DNA, respectively, in good agreement with the scaling exponent of $\nu$ $\cong$ 0.588 predicted by renormalization group theory for polymers with significant excluded volume interactions. Our findings thus provide evidence in support of several theories that predict an effective diameter of DNA much greater than the Debye screening length. In addition, the measured ratio D Circular/D Linear = 1.32 $\pm$ 0.014 was closer to the value of 1.45 predicted by using renormalization group theory than the value of 1.18 predicted by classical Kirkwood hydrodynamic theory and agreed well with a value of 1.31 predicted when incorporating a recently proposed expression for the radius of gyration of circular polymers into the Zimm model.},

  abstract = {The recognition and pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis is a complex physical and molecular process involving a combination of polymer dynamics and molecular recognition events. Two highly conserved features of meiotic chromosome behavior are the attachment of telomeres to the nuclear envelope and the active random motion of telomeres driven by their interaction with cytoskeletal motor proteins. Both of these features have been proposed to facilitate the process of homolog pairing, but exactly what role these features play in meiosis remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the roles of active motion and nuclear envelope tethering using a Brownian dynamics simulation in which meiotic chromosomes are represented by a Rouse polymer model subjected to tethering and active forces at the telomeres. We find that tethering telomeres to the nuclear envelope slows down pairing relative to the rates achieved by unattached chromosomes, but that randomly directed active forces applied to the telomeres speed up pairing dramatically in a manner that depends on the statistical properties of the telomere force fluctuations. The increased rate of initial pairing cannot be explained by stretching out of the chromosome conformation but instead seems to correlate with anomalous diffusion of sub-telomeric regions.},

Methods with sufficient temporal resolution to study the dynamics of diffusing molecules can only sample relatively small regions, whereas methods that are capable of imaging larger areas cannot probe fast timescales. To overcome these limitations, we developed and implemented time-integrated multipoint moment analysis (TIMMA), a form of fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy that is capable of probing timescales down to 20 $\mu$s at hundreds of different locations simultaneously in a sample. We show that TIMMA can be used to measure the diffusion of small-molecule dyes and fluorescent colloids, and that it can create spatial maps of the behavior of soluble fluorescent proteins throughout mammalian tissue culture cells. We also demonstrate that TIMMA can characterize internal gradients in the diffusion of freely moving proteins in single cells.},

  abstract = {Chromatin structure and dynamics control all aspects of DNA biology yet are poorly understood, especially at large length scales. We developed an approach, displacement correlation spectroscopy based on time-resolved image correlation analysis, to map chromatin dynamics simultaneously across the whole nucleus in cultured human cells. This method revealed that chromatin movement was coherent across large regions (4\textendash{}5 $\mathrm{\mu}$m) for several seconds. Regions of coherent motion extended beyond the boundaries of single-chromosome territories, suggesting elastic coupling of motion over length scales much larger than those of genes. These large-scale, coupled motions were ATP dependent and unidirectional for several seconds, perhaps accounting for ATP-dependent directed movement of single genes. Perturbation of major nuclear ATPases such as DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase II, and topoisomerase II eliminated micron-scale coherence, while causing rapid, local movement to increase; i.e., local motions accelerated but became uncoupled from their neighbors. We observe similar trends in chromatin dynamics upon inducing a direct DNA damage; thus we hypothesize that this may be due to DNA damage responses that physically relax chromatin and block long-distance communication of forces.},

  abstract = {Following recent observations of large scale correlated motion of chromatin inside the nuclei of live differentiated cells, we present a hydrodynamic theory\textemdash{}the two-fluid model\textemdash{}in which the content of a nucleus is described as a chromatin solution with the nucleoplasm playing the role of the solvent and the chromatin fiber that of a solute. This system is subject to both passive thermal fluctuations and active scalar and vector events that are associated with free energy consumption, such as ATP hydrolysis. Scalar events drive the longitudinal viscoelastic modes (where the chromatin fiber moves relative to the solvent) while vector events generate the transverse modes (where the chromatin fiber moves together with the solvent). Using linear response methods, we derive explicit expressions for the response functions that connect the chromatin density and velocity correlation functions to the corresponding correlation functions of the active sources and the complex viscoelastic moduli of the chromatin solution. We then derive general expressions for the flow spectral density of the chromatin velocity field. We use the theory to analyze experimental results recently obtained by one of the present authors and her co-workers. We find that the time dependence of the experimental data for both native and ATP-depleted chromatin can be well-fitted using a simple model\textemdash{}the Maxwell fluid\textemdash{}for the complex modulus, although there is some discrepancy in terms of the wavevector dependence. Thermal fluctuations of ATP-depleted cells are predominantly longitudinal. ATP-active cells exhibit intense transverse long wavelength velocity fluctuations driven by force dipoles. Fluctuations with wavenumbers larger than a few inverse microns are dominated by concentration fluctuations with the same spectrum as thermal fluctuations but with increased intensity.},

  abstract = {The nuclear envelope (NE) presents a physical boundary between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm, sandwiched in between two highly active systems inside the cell: cytoskeleton and chromatin. NE defines the shape and size of the cell nucleus, which increases during the cell cycle, accommodating for chromosome decondensation followed by genome duplication. In this work, we study nuclear shape fluctuations at short time scales of seconds in human cells. Using spinning disk confocal microscopy, we observe fast fluctuations of the NE, visualized by fluorescently labeled lamin A, and of the chromatin globule surface (CGS) underneath the NE, visualized by fluorescently labeled histone H2B. Our findings reveal that fluctuation amplitudes of both CGS and NE monotonously decrease during the cell cycle, serving as a reliable cell cycle stage indicator. Remarkably, we find that, while CGS and NE typically fluctuate in phase, they do exhibit localized regions of out-of-phase motion, which lead to separation of NE and CGS. To explore the mechanism behind these shape fluctuations, we use biochemical perturbations. We find the shape fluctuations of CGS and NE to be both thermally and actively driven, the latter caused by forces from chromatin and cytoskeleton. Such undulations might affect gene regulation as well as contribute to the anomalously high rates of nuclear transport by, e.g., stirring of molecules next to NE, or increasing flux of molecules through the nuclear pores.},

We then use a general physical model of particle dispersion in a deforming fluid domain to show that transport of organelle-sized particles between the cell periphery and the bulk can be enhanced by dynamic deformation comparable to that observed in neutrophils.

Ura(+) random spores were selected and gene conversion vs. crossover events were distinguished by Southern blot analysis. Approximately 15\% of the crossover events between chromosomes V and XV were associated with missegregation of one of these chromosomes. The missegregation was manifest as hyperploid spores containing either both translocations plus a normal chromosome, or both normal chromosomes plus one of the translocations. In those cases where it could be analyzed, missegregation occurred at the first meiotic division. These data are discussed in terms of a model in which ectopic crossovers compete efficiently with normal allelic crossovers in directing meiotic chromosome segregation.},

Homolog synapsis, mediated by the synaptonemal complex (SC), is preceded by a stage of pairing between the centromeres of nonhomologous chromosomes. This pairing, named nonhomologous centromere coupling (NCC), depends upon the meiotic cohesin Rec8 and the SC protein Zip1. Nonhomologously coupled centromeres (NCCs), if remain tethered, must interfere with complete homolog synapsis (SC formation). Recent experiments demonstrate the existence of a mechanism that regulates NCC. Importantly, this is part of a regulatory network which couples dissolution of the NCCs with SC formation between the homologous chromosomes, thereby ensuring appropriate meiotic chromosome interactions. This paper reviews this network and presents speculations relating to the initiation of SC formation at centromere.},

  abstract = {Meiosis is the specialized eukaryotic cell division that permits the halving of ploidy necessary for gametogenesis in sexually reproducing organisms. This involves a single round of DNA replication followed by two successive divisions. To ensure balanced segregation, homologous chromosome pairs must migrate to opposite poles at the first meiotic division and this means that they must recognize and pair with each other beforehand. Although understanding of the mechanisms by which meiotic chromosomes find and pair with their homologs has greatly advanced, it remains far from being fully understood. With some notable exceptions such as male Drosophila, the recognition and physical linkage of homologs at the first meiotic division involves homologous recombination. However, in addition to this, it is clear that many organisms, including plants, have also evolved a series of recombination-independent mechanisms to facilitate homolog recognition and pairing. These implicate chromosome structure and dynamics, telomeres, centromeres, and, most recently, small RNAs. With a particular focus on plants, we present here an overview of understanding of these early, recombination-independent events that act in the pairing of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division.
SUMMARY
Meiosis is the specialized cell division which carries out the necessary halving of the chromosome complement in eukaryotic gametogenesis. The ordered segregation of meiotic chromosomes is ensured by recombination in most eukaryotes, but other mechanisms also act. With a particular focus on plants, we present here an overview of understanding of these early, recombination-independent events that act in the pairing of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division.},

  abstract = {Interphase chromosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are tethered to the nuclear envelope at their telomeres and to the spindle pole body (SPB) at their centromeres. Using a polymer model of yeast chromosomes that includes these interactions, we show theoretically that telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope is a major determinant of gene positioning within the nucleus only for genes within 10 kb of the telomeres. We test this prediction by measuring the distance between the SPB and the silent mating locus (HML) on chromosome III in wild\textendash{}type and mutant yeast strains that contain altered chromosome-tethering interactions. In wild-type yeast cells we find that disruption of the telomere tether does not dramatically change the position of HML with respect to the SPB, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Alternatively, using a mutant strain with a synthetic tether that localizes an HML-proximal site to the nuclear envelope, we find a significant change in the SPB-HML distance, again as predicted by theory. Our study quantifies the importance of tethering at telomeres on the organization of interphase chromosomes in yeast, which has been shown to play a significant role in determining chromosome function such as gene expression and recombination.},

The method employs ionizing radiation and is based on the concept that such radiation induces correlated breaks in DNA strands that are in spatial proximity. Human dermal fibroblasts in G0phase of the cell cycle and Chinese hamster ovary cells in mitosis were irradiated by X-rays or accelerated ions. Following lysis of the cells, DNA fragments induced by correlated breaks were end-labeled and separated according to size on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. A characteristic peak was obtained for a fragment size of 78 bases, which is the size that corresponds to one turn of DNA around the nucleosome. Additional peaks between 175 and 450 bases reflect the relative position of nearest-neighbor nucleosomes. Theoretical calculations that simulate the indirect and direct effect of radiation on DNA demonstrate that the fragment size distributions are closely related to the chromatin structure model used. Comparison of the experimental data with theoretical results support a zig-zag model of the chromatin fiber rather than a simple helical model. Thus, radiation-induced damage analysis can provide information on chromatin structure in the living cell.},

Cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections is a relatively new technique, which enables direct high-resolution observation of the cell structures in a close-to-native state. We used cryo-electron microscopy and image processing to further investigate the presence of 30-nm chromatin fibers in human mitotic chromosomes. HeLa S3 cells were vitrified by high-pressure freezing, thin-sectioned, and then imaged under the cryo-electron microscope without any further chemical treatment or staining. For an unambiguous interpretation of the images, the effects of the contrast transfer function were computationally corrected. The mitotic chromosomes of the HeLa S3 cells appeared as compact structures with a homogeneous grainy texture, in which there were no visible 30-nm fibers. Power spectra of the chromosome images also gave no indication of 30-nm chromatin folding. These results, together with our observations of the effects of chromosome swelling, strongly suggest that, within the bulk of compact metaphase chromosomes, the nucleosomal fiber does not undergo 30-nm folding, but exists in a highly disordered and interdigitated state, which is, on the local scale, comparable with a polymer melt.},

  abstract = {While much is known about DNA structure on the basepair level, this scale represents only a fraction of the structural levels involved in folding the genomic material. With recent advances in experimental and theoretical techniques, a variety of structures have been observed on the fiber, gene, and chromosome levels of genome organization. Here we view chromatin architecture from nucleosomes and fibers to genes and chromosomes, highlighting the rich structural diversity and fiber fluidity emerging from both experimental and theoretical techniques. In this context, we discuss our recently proposed folding mechanism, which we call ``hierarchical looping'', similar to rope flaking used in mountain climbing, where 10-nm zigzag chromatin fibers are compacted laterally into self-associating loops which then stack and fold in space. We propose that hierarchical looping may act as a bridge between fibers and genes as well as provide a mechanism to relate key features of interphase and metaphase chromosome architecture to genome structural changes. This motif emerged by analysis of ultrastructural internucleosome contact data by electron microscopy-assisted nucleosome interaction capture cross-linking experiments, in combination with mesoscale modeling. We suggest that while the local folding of chromatin can be regulated at the fiber level by adjustment of internal factors such as linker-histone binding affinities, linker DNA lengths, and divalent ion levels, hierarchical looping on the gene level can additionally be controlled by posttranslational modifications and external factors such as polycomb group proteins. From a combination of 3C data and mesoscale modeling, we suggest that hierarchical looping could also play a role in epigenetic gene silencing, as stacked loops may occlude access to transcription start sites. With advances in crystallography, single-molecule in~vitro biochemistry, in~vivo imaging techniques, and genome-wide contact data experiments, various modeling approaches are allowing for previously unavailable structural interpretation of these data at multiple spatial and temporal scales. An unprecedented level of productivity and opportunity is on the horizon for the chromatin structure field.},

Chromatin consists of genomic DNA packaged onto nucleosomes\textemdash{}double donut-shaped complexes of histone proteins. Roughly 150 base pairs of DNA are wrapped around each nucleosome with variable lengths of linker DNA in-between. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, Song et al. (p. 376; see the Perspective by Travers) determined the 11 angstrom\textendash{}resolution structure of a 12-nucleosome string of DNA. The segment forms a 30-nanometer fiber structure, which is itself double-helical, like the DNA it packages.
The hierarchical packaging of eukaryotic chromatin plays a central role in transcriptional regulation and other DNA-related biological processes. Here, we report the 11-angstrom\textendash{}resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of 30-nanometer chromatin fibers reconstituted in the presence of linker histone H1 and with different nucleosome repeat lengths. The structures show a histone H1-dependent left-handed twist of the repeating tetranucleosomal structural units, within which the four nucleosomes zigzag back and forth with a straight linker DNA. The asymmetric binding and the location of histone H1 in chromatin play a role in the formation of the 30-nanometer fiber. Our results provide mechanistic insights into how nucleosomes compact into higher-order chromatin fibers.

  abstract = {Recent genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions in different eukaryotes revealed patterns around transcription start sites featuring a nucleosome-free region flanked by a periodic modulation of the nucleosome density. For Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the average in vivo pattern was previously shown to be quantitatively described by a ``nucleosome gas'' model based on the statistical positioning mechanism. However, this simple physical description is challenged by the fact that the pattern differs quantitatively between species and by recent experiments that appear incompatible with statistical positioning, indicating important roles for chromatin remodelers. We undertake a data-driven search for a unified physical model to describe the nucleosome patterns of 12 yeast species and also consider an extension of the model to capture remodeling effects. We are led to a nucleosome gas that takes into account nucleosome breathing, i.e., transient unwrapping of nucleosomal DNA segments. This known biophysical property of nucleosomes rationalizes a ``pressure''-induced dependence of the effective nucleosome size that is suggested by the data. By fitting this model to the data, we find an average energy cost for DNA unwrapping consistent with previous biophysical experiments. Although the available data are not sufficient to reconstruct chromatin remodeling mechanisms, a minimal model extension by one mechanism yields an ``active nucleosome gas'' that can rationalize the behavior of systems with reduced histone\textendash{}DNA ratio and remodeler knockouts. We therefore establish a basis for a physical description of nucleosome patterns that can serve as a null model for sequence-specific effects at individual genes and in models of transcription regulation.},

Recent experiments revealed several conflicting trends of the NRL dependence on the concentrations of histones and other architectural chromatin proteins, both in vitro and in vivo, but a systematic theoretical description of NRL as a function of DNA sequence and epigenetic determinants is currently lacking. To address this problem, we have performed an integrative biophysical and bioinformatics analysis in species ranging from yeast to frog to mouse where NRL was studied as a function of various parameters. We show that in simple eukaryotes such as yeast, a lower limit for the NRL value exists, determined by internucleosome interactions and remodeler action. For higher eukaryotes, also the upper limit exists since NRL is an increasing but saturating function of the linker histone concentration. Counterintuitively, smaller H1 variants or non-histone architectural proteins can initiate larger effects on the NRL due to entropic reasons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that different regimes of the NRL dependence on histone concentrations exist depending on whether DNA sequence-specific effects dominate over boundary effects or vice versa. We consider several classes of genomic regions with apparently different regimes of the NRL variation. As one extreme, our analysis reveals that the period of oscillations of the nucleosome density around bound RNA polymerase coincides with the period of oscillations of positioning sites of the corresponding DNA sequence. At another extreme, we show that although mouse major satellite repeats intrinsically encode well-defined nucleosome preferences, they have no unique nucleosome arrangement and can undergo a switch between two distinct types of nucleosome positioning.},

Conversely they are engineered to be nearly meta-stable and disassembled (and reassembled) in a facile manner to allow rapid access to the underlying DNA during processes such as transcription, replication and DNA repair. Nucleosomes protect the genome from DNA damaging agents and provide a lattice onto which a myriad of epigenetic signals are deposited. Moreover, vast strings of nucleosomes provide a framework for assembly of the chromatin fiber and higher-order chromatin structures.

We found that this calibrated model quantitatively describes hMSH2-hMSH6 induced disassembly rates of nucleosomes with two separate DNA sequences and four distinct histone modification states.

In this work we present a one-dimensional statistical mechanics model to study nucleosome positioning within one such 10 nm fibre. We focus on the case of genomic sheep DNA, and we start from effective potentials valid at infinite dilution and determined from high-resolution in vitro salt dialysis experiments. We study positioning within a polynucleosome chain, and compare the results for genomic DNA to that obtained in the simplest case of homogeneous DNA, where the problem can be mapped to a Tonks gas [1]. First, we consider the simple, analytically solvable, case where nucleosomes are assumed to be point-like. Then, we perform numerical simulations to gauge the effect of their finite size on the nucleosomal distribution probabilities. Finally we compare nucleosome distributions and simulated nuclease digestion patterns for the two cases (homogeneous and sheep DNA), thereby providing testable predictions of the effect of sequence on experimentally observable quantities in experiments on polynucleosome chromatin fibres reconstituted in vitro .},

Each nucleosome, the fundamental unit of chromatin, has 147 base pairs (bp) of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer (Richmond and Davey in Nature 423:145, 2003).

Until now, models for predicting genome-wide nucleosome occupancy have assumed that the DNA associations of neighboring nucleosomes on the genome are independent. We present a new model that relaxes this independence assumption by modeling interactions between adjacent nucleosomes., Results: We show that modeling interactions between adjacent nucleosomes improves genome-wide nucleosome occupancy predictions in an in vitro system that includes only nucleosomes and purified DNA, where the resulting model has a preference for short spacings (linkers) of less than 20 bp in length between neighboring nucleosomes. Since nucleosome occupancy in vitro depends only on properties intrinsic to nucleosomes, these results suggest that the interactions we find are intrinsic to nucleosomes and do not depend on other factors, such as transcription factors and chromatin remodelers. We also show that modeling these intrinsic interactions significantly improves genome-wide predictions of nucleosome occupancy in vivo., Contact: eran.segal@weizmann.ac.il, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Nucleosomes, the basic repeating unit of chromatin, consist of 147 basepairs of DNA that are wrapped in almost two turns around a histone protein octamer core. Because $\sim$3/4 of the human genomic DNA is found within nucleosomes, their position and DNA interaction is an essential determinant for the DNA access of gene-specific transcription factors and other proteins. Here, a DNA lattice model was developed for describing ligand binding in the presence of a nucleosome. The model takes into account intermediate states, in which DNA is partially unwrapped from the histone octamer. This facilitates access of transcription factors to up to 60 DNA basepairs located in the outer turn of nucleosomal DNA, while the inner DNA turn was found to be more resistant to competitive ligand binding. As deduced from quantitative comparisons with recently published experimental data, our model provides a better description than the previously used all-or-none lattice-binding model. Importantly, nucleosome-occupancy maps predicted by the nucleosome-unwrapping model also differed significantly when partial unwrapping of nucleosomal DNA was considered. In addition, large effects on the cooperative binding of transcription factors to multiple binding sites occluded by the nucleosome were apparent. These findings indicate that partial unwrapping of DNA from the histone octamer needs to be taken into account in quantitative models of gene regulation in chromatin.},

  abstract = {Nucleosome core particle is a dynamic structure -- DNA may transiently peel off the histone octamer surface due to thermal fluctuations or the action of chromatin remodeling enzymes. Partial DNA unwrapping enables easier access of DNA-binding factors to their target sites and thus may provide a dominant pathway for effecting rapid and robust access to DNA packaged into chromatin. Indeed, a recent high-resolution map of distances between neighboring nucleosome dyads in $\backslash$emph\{S.cerevisiae\} shows that at least 38.7$\backslash$\% of all nucleosomes are partially unwrapped. The extent of unwrapping follows a stereotypical pattern in the vicinity of genes, reminiscent of the canonical pattern of nucleosome occupancy in which nucleosomes are depleted over promoters and well-positioned over coding regions. To explain these observations, we developed a biophysical model which employs a 10-11 base pair periodic nucleosome energy profile. The profile, based on the pattern of histone-DNA contacts in nucleosome crystal structures and the idea of linker length discretization, accounts for both nucleosome unwrapping and higher-order chromatin structure. Our model reproduces the observed genome-wide distribution of inter-dyad distances, and accounts for patterns of nucleosome occupancy and unwrapping around coding regions. At the same time, our approach explains $\backslash$emph\{in vitro\} measurements of accessibility of nucleosome-covered binding sites, and of nucleosome-induced cooperativity between DNA-binding factors. We are able to rule out several alternative scenarios of nucleosome unwrapping as inconsistent with the genomic data.},

  abstract = {The interaction of proteins binding non-specifically to DNA, as well as the properties of many other interacting ligand-lattice systems important in molecular biology, requires a fundamentally different type of theoretical analysis than that provided by the classical Scatchard independent-binding-site treatment. Exact and relatively simple equations describing the binding of both non-interacting and interacting (co-operative) ligands to a homogeneous one-dimensional lattice are derived in terms of ligand site size, intrinsic binding constant and ligand-ligand co-operativity (equations (10) and (15) in the text). The mathematical approach is based on simple conditional probabilities, and reveals some largely unrecognized characteristics of such lattice binding systems. The results indicate that the binding of any non-interacting ligand covering more than one lattice residue results in non-linear (convex downward) Scatchard plots. The introduction of positive ligand-ligand co-operativity antagonizes this non-linearity, and eventually leads to plots of the opposite curvature. The maxima, limiting slopes, and intercepts of such plots can be used to estimate the required binding parameters. The method can be extended to systems involving heterogeneous ligands, and some types of heterogeneous lattices. Procedures for applying the method to a variety of interacting systems are presented, and a preliminary analysis is carried out for some selected sets of data from the literature.},

Nucleosome positions have generally been determined by examining bulk populations of cells and then correlated with overall gene expression. Here, we describe a technique to determine nucleosome positioning in single cells by virtue of the ability of the nucleosome to protect DNA from GpC methylation. In the acid phosphatase inducible PHO5 gene, we find that there is significant cell-to-cell variation in nucleosome positions and shifts in nucleosome positioning correlate with changes in gene expression. However, nucleosome positioning is not absolute, and even with major shifts in gene expression, some cells fail to change nucleosome configuration. Mutations of the PHO5 promoter that introduce a poly(dA:dT) tract-stimulated gene expression under nonpermissive conditions led to shifts of positioned nucleosomes similar to induction of PHO5. By contrast, mutations that altered AA/TT/AT periodicity reduced gene expression upon PHO5 induction and stabilized nucleosomes in most cells, suggesting that enhanced nucleosome affinity for DNA antagonizes chromatin remodelers. Finally, we determined nucleosome positioning in two regions described as ``fuzzy'' or nucleosome-free when examined in a bulk assay. These regions consisted of distinct nucleosomes with a larger footprint for potential location and an increase population of cells lacking a nucleosome altogether. These data indicate an underlying complexity of nucleosome positioning that may contribute to the flexibility and heterogeneity of gene expression.},

Here, we use fluorescence in situ hybridization in combination with three-dimensional optical microscopy to show that homologous pairing of the somatic chromosome arm 2L in Drosophila occurs by independent initiation of pairing at discrete loci rather than by a processive zippering of sites along the length of chromosome. By evaluating the pairing frequencies of 11 loci on chromosome arm 2L over several timepoints during Drosophila embryonic development, we show that all 11 loci are paired very early in Drosophila development, within 13 h after egg deposition. To elucidate whether such pairing occurs by directed or undirected motion, we analyzed the pairing kinetics of histone loci during nuclear cycle 14. By measuring changes of nuclear length and correlating these changes with progression of time during cycle 14, we were able to express the pairing frequency and distance between homologous loci as a function of time. Comparing the experimentally determined dynamics of pairing to simulations based on previously proposed models of pairing motion, we show that the observed pairing kinetics are most consistent with a constrained random walk model and not consistent with a directed motion model. Thus, we conclude that simple random contacts through diffusion could suffice to allow pairing of homologous sites.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000891},
  abstract = {The positions of nucleosomes in eukaryotic genomes determine which parts of the DNA sequence are readily accessible for regulatory proteins and which are not. Genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions have revealed a salient pattern around transcription start sites, involving a nucleosome-free region (NFR) flanked by a pronounced periodic pattern in the average nucleosome density. While the periodic pattern clearly reflects well-positioned nucleosomes, the positioning mechanism is less clear. A recent experimental study by Mavrich et al. argued that the pattern observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is qualitatively consistent with a "barrier nucleosome model," in which the oscillatory pattern is created by the statistical positioning mechanism of Kornberg and Stryer. On the other hand, there is clear evidence for intrinsic sequence preferences of nucleosomes, and it is unclear to what extent these sequence preferences affect the observed pattern. To test the barrier nucleosome model, we quantitatively analyze yeast nucleosome positioning data both up- and downstream from NFRs. Our analysis is based on the Tonks model of statistical physics which quantifies the interplay between the excluded-volume interaction of nucleosomes and their positional entropy. We find that although the typical patterns on the two sides of the NFR are different, they are both quantitatively described by the same physical model with the same parameters, but different boundary conditions. The inferred boundary conditions suggest that the first nucleosome downstream from the NFR (the +1 nucleosome) is typically directly positioned while the first nucleosome upstream is statistically positioned via a nucleosome-repelling DNA region. These boundary conditions, which can be locally encoded into the genome sequence, significantly shape the statistical distribution of nucleosomes over a range of up to approximately 1,000 bp to each side.},

Evidence is presented that the organization of nucleosomes throughout genes is largely a consequence of statistical packing principles. The genomic sequence specifies the location of the -1 and +1 nucleosomes. The +1 nucleosome forms a barrier against which nucleosomes are packed, resulting in uniform positioning, which decays at farther distances from the barrier.

The mechanisms determining nucleosome positioning are therefore of paramount importance for understanding gene regulation and other events that occur in chromatin, such as transcription, replication, and repair. Here, we review our current understanding of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning: DNA sequence, nonhistone DNA-binding proteins, chromatin-remodeling enzymes, and transcription.

  abstract = {The precise placement of nucleosomes has large regulatory effects on gene expression. Recent work suggests that nucleosome placement is regulated in part by the affinity of the underlying DNA sequence for the histone octamer. Nucleosome locations are also regulated by several different ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes. This raises the question of whether DNA sequence influences the activity of chromatin remodeling enzymes. DNA sequence could most simply regulate nucleosome remodeling through its effect on nucleosome stability. In such a model, unstable nucleosomes would be remodeled faster than stable nucleosomes. It is also possible that certain DNA elements could regulate remodeling by inhibiting the interaction of nucleosomes with the remodeling enzyme. A third possibility is that DNA sequence could regulate the outcome of remodeling by influencing how reaction intermediates collapse into a particular set of stable nucleosomal positions. Here we dissect the contribution from these potential mechanisms to the activities of yeast RSC and human ACF, which are representative members of two major classes of remodeling complexes. We find that varying the histone\textendash{}DNA affinity over 3 orders of magnitude has negligible effects on the rates of nucleosome remodeling and ATP hydrolysis by these two enzymes. This suggests that the rate-limiting step for nucleosome remodeling may not involve the disruption of histone\textendash{}DNA contacts. We further find that a specific curved DNA element previously hypothesized to inhibit ACF activity does not inhibit substrate binding or remodeling by ACF. The element, however, does influence the distribution of nucleosome positions generated by ACF. Our data support a model in which remodeling enzymes move nucleosomes to new locations by a general sequence-independent mechanism. However, consequent to the rate-limiting remodeling step, the local DNA sequence promotes a collapse of remodeling intermediates into highly resolved positions that are dictated by thermodynamic differences between adjacent positions.},

Here, we study mobility of nucleosomes formed on telomeric sequences as a function of temperature and ionic strength. We find that telomeric nucleosomes are highly intrinsically mobile under physiological conditions, whereas nucleosomes formed on an average DNA sequence mostly remain in the initial position. This indicates that DNA sequence affects not only the thermodynamic stability and the positioning of nucleosomes but also their dynamic properties. Moreover, our findings suggest that the high mobility of telomeric nucleosomes may be relevant to the dynamics of telomeric chromatin.},

DNA movement on the entry side of the nucleosome occurs only after 7~bp of exit-side translocation, and each entry-side step draws in a 3~bp equivalent of DNA that allows three additional base pairs to be moved to the exit side.

The quantization of repeat lengths applies even for very long repeat lengths. This suggests a model for the origin of the quantization, in which the quantization arises from the requirements of higher-order chromatin structure.},

In contrast with previous approaches, we employ an analogy between a classical one-dimensional fluid of finite-size particles in an arbitrary external potential and arrays of DNA-bound histone octamers. We derive an analytical solution to infer free energies of nucleosome formation directly from nucleosome occupancies measured in high-throughput experiments. The sequence-specific part of free energies is then captured by fitting them to a sum of energies assigned to individual nucleotide motifs. We have developed hierarchical models of increasing complexity and spatial resolution, establishing that nucleosome occupancies can be explained by systematic differences in mono- and dinucleotide content between nucleosomal and linker DNA sequences, with periodic dinucleotide distributions and longer sequence motifs playing a minor role. Furthermore, similar sequence signatures are exhibited by control experiments in which nucleosome-free genomic DNA is either sonicated or digested with micrococcal nuclease, making it possible that current predictions based on high-throughput nucleosome-positioning maps are biased by experimental artifacts.},

  abstract = {Quantitative analysis of epigenetic memory
To explore quantitative and dynamic properties of transcriptional regulation by epigenetic modifications, Bintu et al. monitored a transcriptional reporter gene carried on a human artificial chromosome in Chinese hamster ovary cells (see the Perspective by Keung and Khalil). They measured effects of DNA methylation and histone modifications by methylation or deacetylation in single cells using time-lapse microscopy. Silencing was an all-or-none, stochastic event, so graded adjustments to transcription occurred from changes in the proportion of cells that responded. Furthermore, the duration of recruitment of the chromatin regulators determined the fraction of cells that were silenced. Thus, distinct modifiers can produce different characteristics of epigenetic memory.
Science, this issue p. 720; see also p. 661
Chromatin regulators play a major role in establishing and maintaining gene expression states. Yet how they control gene expression in single cells, quantitatively and over time, remains unclear. We used time-lapse microscopy to analyze the dynamic effects of four silencers associated with diverse modifications: DNA methylation, histone deacetylation, and histone methylation. For all regulators, silencing and reactivation occurred in all-or-none events, enabling the regulators to modulate the fraction of cells silenced rather than the amount of gene expression. These dynamics could be described by a three-state model involving stochastic transitions between active, reversibly silent, and irreversibly silent states. Through their individual transition rates, these regulators operate over different time scales and generate distinct types of epigenetic memory. Our results provide a framework for understanding and engineering mammalian chromatin regulation and epigenetic memory.

  abstract = {Metazoan genomes are spatially organized at multiple scales, from packaging of DNA around individual nucleosomes to segregation of whole chromosomes into distinct territories1,2,3,4,5. At the intermediate scale of kilobases to megabases, which encompasses the sizes of genes, gene clusters and regulatory domains, the three-dimensional (3D) organization of DNA is implicated in multiple gene regulatory mechanisms2,3,4,6,7,8, but understanding this organization remains a challenge. At this scale, the genome is partitioned into domains of different epigenetic states that are essential for regulating gene expression9,10,11. Here we investigate the 3D organization of chromatin in different epigenetic states using super-resolution imaging. We classified genomic domains in Drosophila cells into transcriptionally active, inactive or Polycomb-repressed states, and observed distinct chromatin organizations for each state. All three types of chromatin domains exhibit power-law scaling between their physical sizes in 3D and their domain lengths, but each type has a distinct scaling exponent. Polycomb-repressed domains show the densest packing and most intriguing chromatin folding behaviour, in which chromatin packing density increases with domain length. Distinct from the self-similar organization displayed by transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin, the Polycomb-repressed domains are characterized by a high degree of chromatin intermixing within the domain. Moreover, compared to inactive domains, Polycomb-repressed domains spatially exclude neighbouring active chromatin to a much stronger degree. Computational modelling and knockdown experiments suggest that reversible chromatin interactions mediated by Polycomb-group proteins play an important role in these unique packaging properties of the repressed chromatin. Taken together, our super-resolution images reveal distinct chromatin packaging for different epigenetic states at the kilobase-to-megabase scale, a length scale that is directly relevant to genome regulation.},

However, this secondary structure of chromatin remains poorly understood compared with the primary structure of single nucleosomes or the tertiary structure of long-range looping interactions4. Here we report the first genome-wide map of chromatin conformation in human cells at the 1\textendash{}3 nucleosome (50\textendash{}500 bp) scale, obtained using ionizing radiation-induced spatially correlated cleavage of DNA with sequencing (RICC-seq) to identify DNA\textendash{}DNA contacts that are spatially proximal.

We infer differences in the likelihood of nucleosome\textendash{}nucleosome contacts among open chromatin, H3K27me3-marked, and H3K9me3-marked repressed chromatin regions. After calibrating RICC-seq signal to three-dimensional distances, we show that compact two-start helical fibre structures with stacked alternating nucleosomes are consistent with RICC-seq fragmentation patterns from H3K9me3-marked chromatin, while non-compact structures and solenoid structures are consistent with open chromatin. Our data support a model of chromatin architecture in intact interphase nuclei consistent with variable longitudinal compaction of two-start helical fibres.},

  abstract = {Nucleosomes sterically occlude their wrapped DNA from interacting with many large protein complexes. How proteins gain access to nucleosomal DNA target sites in vivo is not known. Outer stretches of nucleosomal DNA spontaneously unwrap and rewrap with high frequency, providing rapid and efficient access to regulatory DNA target sites located there; however, rates for access to the nucleosome interior have not been measured. Here we show that for a selected high-affinity nucleosome positioning sequence, the spontaneous DNA unwrapping rate decreases dramatically with distance inside the nucleosome. The rewrapping rate also decreases, but only slightly. Our results explain the previously known strong position dependence on the equilibrium accessibility of nucleosomal DNA, which is characteristic of both selected and natural sequences. Our results point to slow nucleosome conformational fluctuations as a potential source of cell\textendash{}cell variability in gene activation dynamics, and they reveal the dominant kinetic path by which multiple DNA binding proteins cooperatively invade a nucleosome.},

  abstract = {Summary
In yeast, histone H3/H4 exchange independent of replication is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the deposition of histone H3 molecules, synthesized during G1, using a high-density microarray histone exchange assay. While we found that H3 exchange in coding regions requires high levels of transcription, promoters exchange H3 molecules in the absence of transcription. In inactive promoters, H3 is deposited predominantly in well-positioned nucleosomes surrounding nucleosome-free regions, indicating that some nucleosomes in promoters are dynamic. This could facilitate induction of repressed genes. Importantly, we show that histone H3 K56 acetylation, a replication-associated mark, is also present in replication-independent newly assembled nucleosomes and correlates perfectly with the deposition of new H3. Finally, we found that transcription-dependent incorporation of H3 at promoters is highly dependent on Asf1. Taken together, our data underline the dynamic nature of replication-independent nucleosome assembly/disassembly, specify a link to transcription, and implicate Asf1 and H3 K56 acetylation.},

To assay the dynamic behavior of chromatin in living cells, we used genomic tiling arrays to measure histone H3 turnover in G1-arrested Saccharomyces cerevisiae at single-nucleosome resolution over 4\% of the genome, and at lower ($\sim$265 base pair) resolution over the entire genome. We find that nucleosomes at promoters are replaced more rapidly than at coding regions and that replacement rates over coding regions correlate with polymerase density. In addition, rapid histone turnover is found at known chromatin boundary elements. These results suggest that rapid histone turnover serves to functionally separate chromatin domains and prevent spread of histone states.
Regions of chromatin that are epigenetically silenced and highly regulated are coated with histones that rapidly bind and release the DNA.

After six rounds of selection, individual molecules from the library showed 20- to 100-fold greater j-factors compared with the starting library, validating the selection protocol. High-throughput sequencing revealed a sinusoidal pattern of enrichment and de-enrichment of A/T dinucleotides in the random region with a 10.4 base pair period associated with the helicity of DNA. A similar, but more moderate pattern of C/G dinucleotides was offset by precisely half a helical turn. While C/G dinucleotide enrichments were evenly distributed, A/T dinucleotide enrichments displayed a preference to cluster in individual DNA molecules. The most highly enriched 10 base pair sequences in the random region contained adjacent blocks of A/T and C/G trinucleotides present in some, but not all, rapidly cyclizing molecules. The phased dinucleotide enrichments closely match those present in accurately mapped yeast nucleosomes, confirming the importance of DNA bending in nucleosome formation. However, at certain sites the nucleosomal DNAs show dinucleotide enrichments that differ substantially from the cyclization data. These discrepancies can often be correlated with sequence specific contacts that form between histones and DNA. \textcopyright{} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment) experiments and similar sequence selection experiments have been used extensively to examine the (indirect readout) sequence preferences of, e.g., nucleosomes (protein spools around which DNA is wound for compactification) and DNA rings. We show how recently developed computational and theoretical tools can be used to emulate such experiments in silico. Opening up this possibility comes with several benefits. First, it allows us a better understanding of our models and systems, specifically about the roles played by the simulation temperature and the selection pressure on the sequences. Second, it allows us to compare the predictions made by the model of choice with experimental results. We find agreement on important features between predictions of the rigid base-pair model and experimental results for DNA rings and interesting differences that point out open questions in the field. Finally, our simulations allow application of the SELEX methodology to systems that are experimentally difficult to realize because they come with high energetic costs and are therefore unlikely to form spontaneously, such as very short or overwound DNA rings.},

Linear DNA, up to 48'502 base pairs (bp), was irreversibly deposited from a solution onto silanized mica and imaged in air. Under the adsorption conditions used, the DNA is trapped onto the surface without any two-dimensional equilibration.

  abstract = {Mammalian chromatin is organized on length scales ranging from individual nucleosomes to chromosomal territories. At intermediate scales two dominant features emerge in interphase: (i) alternating regions ($<$5Mb) of active and inactive chromatin that spatially segregate into different compartments, and (ii) domains ($<$1Mb), i.e. regions that preferentially interact internally, which are also termed topologically associating domains (TADs) and are central to gene regulation. There is growing evidence that TADs are formed by active extrusion of chromatin loops by cohesin, whereas compartments are established by a phase separation process according to local chromatin states. Here we use polymer simulations to examine how the two processes, loop extrusion and compartmental segregation, work collectively and potentially interfere in shaping global chromosome organization. Our integrated model faithfully reproduces Hi-C data from previously puzzling experimental observations, where targeting of the TAD-forming machinery led to changes in compartmentalization. Specifically, depletion of chromatin-associated cohesin reduced TADs and revealed hidden, finer compartments, while increased processivity of cohesin led to stronger TADs and reduced compartmentalization, and depletion of the TAD boundary protein, CTCF, weakened TADs while leaving compartments unaffected. We reveal that these experimental perturbations are special cases of a general polymer phenomenon of active mixing by loop extrusion. This also predicts that interference with chromatin epigenetic states or nuclear volume would affect compartments but not TADs. Our results suggest that chromatin organization on the megabase scale emerges from competition of non-equilibrium active loop extrusion and epigenetically defined compartment structure.},

We found that partially unwrapped nucleosomes and subnucleosome-sized particles can occupy the same position within a cell population, suggesting dynamic behavior. By varying the time of MNase digestion, we have been able to observe changes that reflect differential sensitivity of particles, including the eviction of nucleosomes. To characterize DNA-binding features of transcription factors, we plotted the length of each fragment versus its position in the genome, which defined the minimal protected region of each factor. This process led to the precise mapping of protected and exposed regions at and around binding sites, and also determination of the degree to which they are flanked by phased nucleosomes and subnucleosome-sized particles. Our protocol and mapping method provide a general strategy for epigenome characterization, including nucleosome phasing and dynamics, ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelers, and transcription factors, from a single-sequenced sample.},

  abstract = {Because DNA packaging in nucleosomes modulates its accessibility to transcription factors (TFs), unraveling the causal determinants of nucleosome positioning is of great importance to understanding gene regulation. Although there is evidence that intrinsic sequence specificity contributes to nucleosome positioning, the extent to which other factors contribute to nucleosome positioning is currently highly debated. Here we obtained both in vivo and in vitro reference maps of positions that are either consistently covered or free of nucleosomes across multiple experimental data-sets in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We then systematically quantified the contribution of TF binding to nucleosome positiong using a rigorous statistical mechanics model in which TFs compete with nucleosomes for binding DNA. Our results reconcile previous seemingly conflicting results on the determinants of nucleosome positioning and provide a quantitative explanation for the difference between in vivo and in vitro positioning. On a genome-wide scale, nucleosome positioning is dominated by the phasing of nucleosome arrays over gene bodies, and their positioning is mainly determined by the intrinsic sequence preferences of nucleosomes. In contrast, larger nucleosome free regions in promoters, which likely have a much more significant impact on gene expression, are determined mainly by TF binding. Interestingly, of the 158 yeast TFs included in our modeling, we find that only 10\textendash{}20 significantly contribute to inducing nucleosome-free regions, and these TFs are highly enriched for having direct interations with chromatin remodelers. Together our results imply that nucleosome free regions in yeast promoters results from the binding of a specific class of TFs that recruit chromatin remodelers.},

  abstract = {Nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) at the 5${'}$ and 3${'}$ ends of genes are general sites of transcription initiation for mRNA and noncoding RNA (ncRNA). The presence of NFRs within transcriptional regulatory regions and the conserved location of transcription start sites at NFRs strongly suggest that the regulation of NFRs profoundly affects transcription initiation. To date, multiple factors are known to facilitate transcription initiation by positively regulating the formation and/or size of NFRs in vivo. However, mechanisms to repress transcription by negatively regulating the size of NFRs have not been identified. We identified four distinct classes of NFRs located at the 5${'}$ and 3${'}$ ends of genes, within open reading frames (ORFs), and far from ORFs. The ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzyme Isw2 was found enriched at all classes of NFRs. Analysis of RNA levels also demonstrated Isw2 is required to repress ncRNA transcription from many of these NFRs. Thus, by the systematic annotation of NFRs across the yeast genome and analysis of ncRNA transcription, we established, for the first time, a mechanism by which NFR size is negatively regulated to repress ncRNA transcription from NFRs. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting that one biological consequence of repression of ncRNA, by Isw2 or by the exosome, is prevention of transcriptional interference of mRNA.},

Our model predicts a broad range of preferred helix structures for a fixed linker length of DNA; changing the linker length alters the predicted ensemble. Specifically, we find that the twist registry of the nucleosomes, as set by the internucleosome repeat length, determines the preferred angle between the nucleosomes and the fiber axis. For~moderate to long linker lengths, we find a number of energetically comparable configurations with different nucleosome-nucleosome interaction patterns, indicating a potential role for kinetic trapping in chromatin fiber formation. Our results highlight the key role played by DNA elasticity and local geometry in regulating the hierarchical packaging of the genome.},

We also identified mutations on PRC2 subunit Su(z)12, which impair its binding and response to the activating peptide and its ability in establishing H3K27 trimethylation levels in vivo. In mouse embryonic stem cells, local chromatin compaction occurs before the formation of trimethylated H3K27 upon transcription cessation of the retinoic acid\textendash{}regulated gene CYP26a1.

The nuclei of human cells contain 2 meters of genomic DNA. How does it all fit? Compaction starts with the DNA wrapping around histone octamers to form nucleosomes, but it is unclear how these further compress into mitotic chromosomes. Ou et al. describe a DNA-labeling method that allows them to visualize chromatin organization in human cells (see the Perspective by Larson and Misteli). They show that chromatin forms flexible chains with diameters between 5 and 24 nm. In mitotic chromosomes, chains bend back on themselves to pack at high density, whereas during interphase, the chromatin chains are more extended.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONIn human cells, 2 m of DNA are compacted in the nucleus through assembly with histones and other proteins into chromatin structures, megabase three-dimensional (3D) domains, and chromosomes that determine the activity and inheritance of our genomes. The long-standing textbook model is that primary 11-nm DNA\textendash{}core nucleosome polymers assemble into 30-nm fibers that further fold into 120-nm chromonema, 300- to 700-nm chromatids, and, ultimately, mitotic chromosomes. Further extrapolating from this model, silent heterochromatin is generally depicted as 30- and 120-nm fibers. The hierarchical folding model is based on the in vitro structures formed by purified DNA and nucleosomes and on chromatin fibers observed in permeabilized cells from which other components had been extracted. Unfortunately, there has been no method that enables DNA and chromatin ultrastructure to be visualized and reconstructed unambiguously through large 3D volumes of intact cells. Thus, a remaining question is, what are the local and global 3D chromatin structures in the nucleus that determine the compaction and function of the human genome in interphase cells and mitotic chromosomes?
RATIONALETo visualize and reconstruct chromatin ultrastructure and 3D organization across multiple scales in the nucleus, we developed ChromEMT, which combines electron microscopy tomography (EMT) with a labeling method (ChromEM) that selectivity enhances the contrast of DNA. This technique exploits a fluorescent dye that binds to DNA, and upon excitation, catalyzes the deposition of diaminobenzidine polymers on the surface, enabling chromatin to be visualized with OsO4 in EM. Advances in multitilt EMT allow us to reveal the chromatin ultrastructure and 3D packing of DNA in both human interphase cells and mitotic chromosomes.
RESULTSChromEMT enables the ultrastructure of individual chromatin chains, heterochromatin domains, and mitotic chromosomes to be resolved in serial slices and their 3D organization to be visualized as a continuum through large nuclear volumes in situ. ChromEMT stains and detects 30-nm fibers in nuclei purified from hypotonically lysed chicken erythrocytes and treated with MgCl2. However, we do not observe higher-order fibers in human interphase and mitotic cells in situ. Instead, we show that DNA and nucleosomes assemble into disordered chains that have diameters between 5 and 24 nm, with different particle arrangements, densities, and structural conformations. Chromatin has a more extended curvilinear structure in interphase nuclei and collapses into compact loops and interacting arrays in mitotic chromosome scaffolds. To analyze chromatin packing, we create 3D grid maps of chromatin volume concentrations (CVCs) in situ. We find that interphase nuclei have subvolumes with CVCs ranging from 12 to 52\% and distinct spatial distribution patterns, whereas mitotic chromosome subvolumes have CVCs $>$40\%.
CONCLUSIONWe conclude that chromatin is a flexible and disordered 5- to 24-nm-diameter granular chain that is packed together at different concentration densities in interphase nuclei and mitotic chromosomes. The overall primary structure of chromatin polymers does not change in mitotic chromosomes, which helps to explain the rapid dynamics of chromatin condensation and how epigenetic interactions and structures can be inherited through cell division. In contrast to rigid fibers that have longer fixed persistence lengths, disordered 5- to 24-nm-diameter chromatin chains are flexible and can bend at various lengths to achieve different levels of compaction and high packing densities. The diversity of chromatin structures is exciting and provides a structural basis for how different combinations of DNA sequences, interactions, linker lengths, histone variants, and modifications can be integrated to fine-tune the function of genomic DNA in the nucleus to specify cell fate. Our data also suggest that the assembly of 3D domains in the nucleus with different chromatin concentrations, rather than higher-order folding, determines the global accessibility and activity of DNA. $<$img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/357/6349/eaag0025/F1.medium.gif"/$>$ Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint ChromEMT reveals the in situ chromatin ultrastructure, 3D packing, and organization of DNA.EMT sample volume-DNA-nucleosome chains are black. Chromatin is a structurally disordered 5- to 24-nm granular chain that is packed together at different 3D CVC densities in human interphase nuclei and mitotic chromosomes (red, high density; yellow, medium density; blue, low density).
The chromatin structure of DNA determines genome compaction and activity in the nucleus. On the basis of in vitro structures and electron microscopy (EM) studies, the hierarchical model is that 11-nanometer DNA-nucleosome polymers fold into 30- and subsequently into 120- and 300- to 700-nanometer fibers and mitotic chromosomes. To visualize chromatin in situ, we identified a fluorescent dye that stains DNA with an osmiophilic polymer and selectively enhances its contrast in EM. Using ChromEMT (ChromEM tomography), we reveal the ultrastructure and three-dimensional (3D) organization of individual chromatin polymers, megabase domains, and mitotic chromosomes. We show that chromatin is a disordered 5- to 24-nanometer-diameter curvilinear chain that is packed together at different 3D concentration distributions in interphase and mitosis. Chromatin chains have many different particle arrangements and bend at various lengths to achieve structural compaction and high packing densities.
A new technique reveals that chromatin is a disordered 5- to 24-nanometer chain that is packed at different concentration densities according to the cell cycle.

We show that nucleosomes occupy DNA targets for a subset of DNA-binding proteins, including CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and pluripotency factors. Furthermore, we provide evidence that promoter-proximal nucleosomes, with the +1 nucleosome in particular, contribute to the pausing of RNA polymerase II. Lastly, we find a characteristic preference for nucleosomes at exon-intron junctions.

  abstract = {Using a recently developed chemical approach, we have generated a genome-wide map of nucleosomes in vivo in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe) at base pair resolution. The shorter linker length previously identified in S. pombe is due to a preponderance of nucleosomes separated by $\sim$4/5 bp, placing nucleosomes on opposite faces of the DNA. The periodic dinucleotide feature thought to position nucleosomes is equally strong in exons as in introns, demonstrating that nucleosome positioning information can be superimposed on coding information. Unlike the case in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, A/T-rich sequences are enriched in S. pombe nucleosomes, particularly at $\pm$20 bp around the dyad. This difference in nucleosome binding preference gives rise to a major distinction downstream of the transcription start site, where nucleosome phasing is highly predictable by A/T frequency in S. pombe but not in S. cerevisiae, suggesting that the genomes and DNA binding preferences of nucleosomes have coevolved in different species. The poly (dA-dT) tracts affect but do not deplete nucleosomes in S. pombe, and they prefer special rotational positions within the nucleosome, with longer tracts enriched in the 10- to 30-bp region from the dyad. S. pombe does not have a well-defined nucleosome-depleted region immediately upstream of most transcription start sites; instead, the -1 nucleosome is positioned with the expected spacing relative to the +1 nucleosome, and its occupancy is negatively correlated with gene expression. Although there is generally very good agreement between nucleosome maps generated by chemical cleavage and micrococcal nuclease digestion, the chemical map shows consistently higher nucleosome occupancy on DNA with high A/T content.},

  abstract = {Dynamics of the nucleosome and exposure of nucleosomal DNA play key roles in many nuclear processes, but local dynamics of the nucleosome and its modulation by DNA sequence are poorly understood. Using single-molecule assays, we observed that the nucleosome can unwrap asymmetrically and directionally under force. The relative DNA flexibility of the inner quarters of nucleosomal DNA controls the unwrapping direction such that the nucleosome unwraps from the stiffer side. If the DNA flexibility is similar on two sides, it stochastically unwraps from either side. The two ends of the nucleosome are orchestrated such that the opening of one end helps to stabilize the other end, providing a mechanism to amplify even small differences in flexibility to a large asymmetry in nucleosome stability. Our discovery of DNA flexibility as a critical factor for nucleosome dynamics and mechanical stability suggests a novel mechanism of gene regulation by DNA sequence and modifications.},

  abstract = {Nucleosomes, DNA spools with a protein core, engage about three-quarters of eukaryotic DNA and play a critical role in chromosomal processes, ranging from gene regulation, recombination, and replication to chromosome condensation. For more than a decade, micromanipulation experiments where nucleosomes are put under tension, as well as the theoretical interpretations of these experiments, have deepened our understanding of the stability and dynamics of nucleosomes. Here we give a theoretical explanation for a surprising new experimental finding: nucleosomes wrapped onto the 601 positioning sequence (the sequence used in most laboratories) respond highly asymmetrically to external forces by always unwrapping from the same end. Using a computational nucleosome model, we show that this asymmetry can be explained by differences in the DNA mechanics of two very short stretches on the wrapped DNA portion. Our finding suggests that the physical properties of nucleosomes, here the response to forces, can be tuned locally by the choice of the underlying base-pair sequence. This leads to a new view of nucleosomes: a physically highly varied set of DNA\textendash{}protein complexes whose properties can be tuned on evolutionary time scales to their specific function in the genomic context.},

This interaction map revealed a distinct $\sim$5-bp periodicity that was enveloped by three broad regions of strong interactions, with the strongest occurring at the dyad and the other two about $\pm$40-bp from the dyad. Unzipping up to the dyad allowed recovery of a canonical nucleosome upon relaxation of the DNA, but unzipping beyond the dyad resulted in removal of the histone octamer from its initial DNA sequence.

  abstract = {Summary
Nucleosomes uniquely positioned on high-affinity DNA sequences present a polar barrier to transcription by human and yeast RNA polymerase II (Pol II). In one transcriptional orientation, these nucleosomes provide a strong, factor- and salt-insensitive barrier at~the entry into the H3/H4 tetramer that can be recapitulated without H2A/H2B dimers. The same nucleosomes transcribed in the opposite orientation form a weaker, more diffuse barrier that is largely relieved by higher salt, TFIIS, or FACT. Barrier properties are therefore dictated by both the local nucleosome structure (influenced by the strength of the histone-DNA interactions) and the location of the high-affinity DNA region within the nucleosome. Pol II transcribes DNA sequences at~the entry into the tetramer much less efficiently than the same sequences located distal to the nucleosome dyad. Thus, entry into the tetramer by Pol II facilitates further transcription, perhaps due to partial unfolding of the tetramer from DNA.},

  abstract = {Constitutive heterochromatin is an important component of eukaryotic genomes that has essential roles in nuclear architecture, DNA repair and genome stability1, and silencing of transposon and gene expression2. Heterochromatin is highly enriched for repetitive sequences, and is defined epigenetically by methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and recruitment of its binding partner heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). A prevalent view of heterochromatic silencing is that these and associated factors lead to chromatin compaction, resulting in steric exclusion of regulatory proteins such as RNA polymerase from the underlying DNA3. However, compaction alone does not account for the formation of distinct, multi-chromosomal, membrane-less heterochromatin domains within the nucleus, fast diffusion of proteins inside the domain, and other dynamic features of heterochromatin. Here we present data that support an alternative hypothesis: that the formation of heterochromatin domains is mediated by phase separation, a phenomenon that gives rise to diverse non-membrane-bound nuclear, cytoplasmic and extracellular compartments4. We show that Drosophila HP1a protein undergoes liquid\textendash{}liquid demixing in vitro, and nucleates into foci that display liquid properties during the first stages of heterochromatin domain formation in early Drosophila embryos. Furthermore, in both Drosophila and mammalian cells, heterochromatin domains exhibit dynamics that are characteristic of liquid phase-separation, including sensitivity to the disruption of weak hydrophobic interactions, and reduced diffusion, increased coordinated movement and inert probe exclusion at the domain boundary. We conclude that heterochromatic domains form via phase separation, and mature into a structure that includes liquid and stable compartments. We propose that emergent biophysical properties associated with phase-separated systems are critical to understanding the unusual behaviours of heterochromatin, and how chromatin domains in general regulate essential nuclear functions.},

Such an endeavor will require improvements in the throughputs and costs of DNA sequencing. Next-generation sequencing platforms have impressively low costs and high throughputs but are limited by short read lengths. An immediate and widely recognized solution to this critical limitation is the paired-end tag (PET) sequencing for various applications, collectively called the PET sequencing strategy, in which short and paired tags are extracted from the ends of long DNA fragments for ultra-high-throughput sequencing. The PET sequences can be accurately mapped to the reference genome, thus demarcating the genomic boundaries of PET-represented DNA fragments and revealing the identities of the target DNA elements. PET protocols have been developed for the analyses of transcriptomes, transcription factor binding sites, epigenetic sites such as histone modification sites, and genome structures. The exclusive advantage of the PET technology is its ability to uncover linkages between the two ends of DNA fragments. Using this unique feature, unconventional fusion transcripts, genome structural variations, and even molecular interactions between distant genomic elements can be unraveled by PET analysis. Extensive use of PET data could lead to efficient assembly of individual human genomes, transcriptomes, and interactomes, enabling new biological and clinical insights. With its versatile and powerful nature for DNA analysis, the PET sequencing strategy has a bright future ahead.},

In particular, DNA replication correlates with a build-up of compartments and a reduction in TAD insulation, while loops are generally stable from G1 to S and G2 phase.

Enhancers regulating pair rule stripes of even-skipped expression activate transcription of a reporter gene over a distance of 150 kb. We show in individual cells that activation only occurs after the enhancer comes into close proximity with its regulatory target and that upon dissociation transcription ceases almost immediately. We further observe distinct topological conformations of the eve locus, depending on the spatial identity of the activating stripe enhancer. In addition, long-range activation results in transcriptional competition at the endogenous eve locus, causing corresponding developmental defects. Overall, we demonstrate that sustained physical proximity and enhancer-promoter engagement are required for enhancer action, and we provide a path to probe the implications of long-range regulation on cellular fates.},

Upon transcriptional activation, chromatin is remodeled and referred to as ``open'', but quantitative and dynamic data of this decompaction process are lacking. Here, we have developed a quantitative high-resolution microscopy assay in living yeast cells to visualize and quantify chromatin dynamics using the GAL7-10-1 locus as a model system. Upon transcriptional activation of these three clustered genes, we detect an increase of the mean distance across this locus by $>$100 nm. This decompaction is linked to active transcription but is not sensitive to the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A or to deletion of the histone acetyl transferase Gcn5. By contrast, the deletion of SNF2 (encoding the ATPase of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex) or the deactivation of the histone chaperone complex FACT lead to a strongly reduced decompaction without significant effects on transcriptional induction. Our findings are consistent with nucleosome remodeling and eviction activities being major contributors to chromatin reorganization during transcription but also suggest that transcription can occur in the absence of detectable decompaction.},

  abstract = {Chromatin is reprogrammed after fertilization to produce a totipotent zygote with the potential to generate a new organism1. The maternal genome inherited from the oocyte and the paternal genome provided by sperm coexist as separate haploid nuclei in the zygote. How these two epigenetically distinct genomes are spatially organized is poorly understood. Existing chromosome conformation capture-based methods2,3,4,5 are not applicable to oocytes and zygotes owing to a paucity of material. To study three-dimensional chromatin organization in rare cell types, we developed a single-nucleus Hi-C (high-resolution chromosome conformation capture) protocol that provides greater than tenfold more contacts per cell than the previous method2. Here we show that chromatin architecture is uniquely reorganized during the oocyte-to-zygote transition in mice and is distinct in paternal and maternal nuclei within single-cell zygotes. Features of genomic organization including compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs) and loops are present in individual oocytes when averaged over the genome, but the presence of each feature at a locus varies between cells. At the sub-megabase level, we observed stochastic clusters of contacts that can occur across TAD boundaries but average into TADs. Notably, we found that TADs and loops, but not compartments, are present in zygotic maternal chromatin, suggesting that these are generated by different mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that the global chromatin organization of zygote nuclei is fundamentally different from that of other interphase cells. An understanding of this zygotic chromatin `ground state' could potentially provide insights into reprogramming cells to a state of totipotency.},

Here, using auxin-inducible degron techniques to acutely deplete CTCF in mouse embryonic stem cells, we show that cell growth is severely slowed yet chromatin organization remains largely intact after loss of CTCF. Depletion of CTCF reduces interactions between chromatin loop anchors, diminishes occupancy of cohesin complex genome-wide, and slightly weakens topologically associating domain (TAD) structure, but the active and inactive chromatin compartments are maintained and the vast majority of TAD boundaries persist. Furthermore, transcriptional regulation and histone marks associated with enhancers are broadly unchanged upon CTCF depletion. Our results suggest CTCF-independent mechanisms in maintenance of chromatin organization.},

  abstract = {The classic model of eukaryotic gene expression requires direct spatial contact between a distal enhancer and a proximal promoter. Recent Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) studies show that enhancers and promoters are embedded in a complex network of looping interactions. Here we use a polymer model of chromatin fiber to investigate whether, and to what extent, looping interactions between elements in the vicinity of an enhancer-promoter pair can influence their contact frequency. Our equilibrium polymer simulations show that a chromatin loop, formed by elements flanking either an enhancer or a promoter, suppresses enhancer-promoter interactions, working as an insulator. A loop formed by elements located in the region between an enhancer and a promoter, on the contrary, facilitates their interactions. We find that different mechanisms underlie insulation and facilitation; insulation occurs due to steric exclusion by the loop, and is a global effect, while facilitation occurs due to an effective shortening of the enhancer-promoter genomic distance, and is a local effect. Consistently, we find that these effects manifest quite differently for in silico 3C and microscopy. Our results show that looping interactions that do not directly involve an enhancer-promoter pair can nevertheless significantly modulate their interactions. This phenomenon is analogous to allosteric regulation in proteins, where a conformational change triggered by binding of a regulatory molecule to one site affects the state of another site.},

There is considerable evidence that chromosome structure plays important roles in gene control, but we have limited understanding of the proteins that contribute to structural interactions between gene promoters and their enhancer elements. Large DNA loops that encompass genes and their regulatory elements depend on CTCF-CTCF interactions, but most enhancer-promoter interactions do not employ this structural protein. Here, we show that the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) contributes to enhancer-promoter structural interactions in a manner analogous to DNA interactions mediated by CTCF. YY1 binds to active enhancers and promoter-proximal elements and forms dimers that facilitate the interaction of these DNA elements. Deletion of YY1 binding sites or depletion of YY1 protein disrupts enhancer-promoter looping and gene expression. We propose that YY1-mediated enhancer-promoter interactions are a general feature of mammalian gene control.},

However, previous studies lack either the resolution or coverage to permit a whole-genome, unbiased view of chromatin interactions. Here we report a comprehensive chromatin interaction map generated in human fibroblasts using a genome-wide 3C analysis method (Hi-C)5. We determined over one million long-range chromatin interactions at 5\textendash{}10-kb resolution, and uncovered general principles of chromatin organization at different types of genomic features. We also characterized the dynamics of promoter\textendash{}enhancer contacts after TNF-$\alpha$ signalling in these cells. Unexpectedly, we found that TNF-$\alpha$-responsive enhancers are already in contact with their target promoters before signalling. Such pre-existing chromatin looping, which also exists in other cell types with different extracellular signalling, is a strong predictor of gene induction. Our observations suggest that the three-dimensional chromatin landscape, once established in a particular cell type, is relatively stable and could influence the selection or activation of target genes by a ubiquitous transcription activator in a cell-specific manner.},

  abstract = {Numerous biological processes are regulated by DNA elements that communicate with their targets over a distance via formation of protein-bridged DNA loops. One of the first questions arising in studies of DNA looping is whether the rate of loop formation is limited by diffusion of the DNA sites. We addressed this question by comparing the in vitro measured rates of transcription initiation in the NtrC-glnAp2 enhancer-dependent transcription initiation system with predictions of two different theoretical models. The promoter and enhancer were in a 7.6-kb plasmid and separated by 2.5 kb. The measurements were performed for different values of the plasmid superhelix density, from 0 to -0.07. Earlier theoretical analysis, based on the Monte Carlo simulation of DNA conformations, showed that if the rate of loop formation is determined by the equilibrium probability of juxtaposition of the DNA sites, the rate should be $\sim$100 times higher in supercoiled than in relaxed DNA. On the other hand, Brownian dynamics simulation showed that if the rate of loop formation is limited by the site diffusion, it should be nearly independent of DNA supercoiling. We found that efficiency of the transcription initiation increases by nearly two orders of magnitude as a result of the corresponding increase of the template supercoiling. This clearly shows that the rate of bridging in the enhancer-promoter system is not limited by diffusion of the DNA sites to one another. We argue that this conclusion derived for the specific system is likely to be valid for the great majority of biological processes involving protein-mediated DNA looping.},

  abstract = {Deciphering the factors that control chromatin fiber structure is key to understanding fundamental chromosomal processes. Although details remain unknown, it is becoming clear that chromatin is polymorphic depending on internal and external factors. In particular, different lengths of the linker DNAs joining successive nucleosomes (measured in nucleosome-repeat lengths or NRLs) that characterize different cell types and cell cycle stages produce different structures. NRL is also nonuniform within single fibers, but how this diversity affects chromatin fiber structure is not clear. Here we perform Monte Carlo simulations of a coarse-grained oligonucleosome model to help interpret fiber structure subject to intrafiber NRL variations, as relevant to proliferating cells of interphase chromatin, fibers subject to remodeling factors, and regulatory DNA sequences. We find that intrafiber NRL variations have a profound impact on chromatin structure, with a wide range of different architectures emerging (highly bent narrow forms, canonical and irregular zigzag fibers, and polymorphic conformations), depending on the NRLs mixed. This stabilization of a wide range of fiber forms might allow NRL variations to regulate both fiber compaction and selective DNA exposure. The polymorphic forms spanning canonical to sharply bent structures, like hairpins and loops, arise from large NRL variations and are surprisingly more compact than uniform NRL structures. They are distinguished by tail-mediated far-nucleosome interactions, in addition to the near-nucleosome interactions of canonical 30-nm fibers. Polymorphism is consistent with chromatin's diverse biological functions and heterogeneous constituents. Intrafiber NRL variations, in particular, may contribute to fiber bending and looping and thus to distant communication in associated regulatory processes.},

  abstract = {We present a theoretical analysis of the structural and mechanical properties of the 30-nm chromatin fiber. Our study is based on the two-angle model introduced by Woodcock et al. (Woodcock, C. L., S. A. Grigoryev, R. A. Horowitz, and N. Whitaker. 1993. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 90:9021-9025) that describes the chromatin fiber geometry in terms of the entry-exit angle of the nucleosomal DNA and the rotational setting of the neighboring nucleosomes with respect to each other. We analytically explore the different structures that arise from this building principle, and demonstrate that the geometry with the highest density is close to the one found in native chromatin fibers under physiological conditions. On the basis of this model we calculate mechanical properties of the fiber under stretching. We obtain expressions for the stress-strain characteristics that show good agreement with the results of recent stretching experiments (Cui, Y., and C. Bustamante. 2000. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 97:127-132) and computer simulations (Katritch, V., C. Bustamante, and W. K. Olson. 2000. J. Mol. Biol. 295:29-40), and which provide simple physical insights into correlations between the structural and elastic properties of chromatin.},

While individual aspects of the genome architecture, such as DNA and nucleosome structure or the arrangement of chromosome territories are well studied, much information is missing for a unified description of cellular DNA at all its structural levels. Computer modeling can contribute to such a description. We present here some typical approaches to models of the chromatin fiber, including different amounts of detail in the description of the local nucleosome structure. The main results from our simulations are that the physical properties of the chromatin fiber can be well described by a simplified model consisting of cylinder-like nucleosomes connected by flexible DNA segments, with a geometry determined by the bending and twisting angles between nucleosomes. Randomness in the local geometry \textendash{} such as random absence of linker histone H1 \textendash{} leads to a dramatic increase in the chromatin fiber flexibility. Furthermore, we show that chromatin is much more flexible to bending than to stretching, and that the structure of the chromatin fiber favors the formation of sharp bends.},

  abstract = {A low-resolution molecular model, which combines the known mechanical properties of protein-free DNA with the accumulating picture of chromatosome structure, has been developed to account for the stretching of single chromatin fibers by an imposed external force. Force-extension characteristics of sets of chains accumulated by Monte Carlo sampling are consistent with recently observed findings in the non-destructive regime ($<$20 pN imposed force), where the structure of the chromatosome remains intact. The correspondence between simulation and the relaxation phase of the experiment limits the equilibrium entry-exit angle of linker DNA on the chromatosome to W=50($\pm$10)$^\circ$ and the effective DNA linker length to Leff=40($\pm$5) bp. The computed force-extension characteristics are relatively insensitive to other parameters of the model, precluding their accurate estimation. The introduction of an attractive potential between closely spaced nucleosomes reproduces the added initial resistance of single fibers to extension at high salt conditions. The consideration of elastic linkers also improves the fitting of assorted classical measurements of unstressed chromatin structure in solution. The overall picture of chromatin that emerges is an irregular, fluctuating, three-dimensional, zig-zag structure with intact, mechanically stable chromatosome units and deformable linkers. The modeled fiber undergoes large-scale configurational rearrangements without significant perturbation of the constituent chromatosome beads, collapsing into a highly condensed form in response to small ($<$2kT) inter-nucleosomal attractions.},

Bridging of the two representations-an area of active research-is necessary for studying integrated functions of large systems of biological importance. Following perspectives of both discrete (N-body) interaction and continuum solvation, we present a new algorithm, DiSCO (Discrete Surface Charge Optimization), for economically describing the electrostatic field predicted by Poisson-Boltzmann theory using a discrete set of Debye-H\"uckel charges distributed on a virtual surface enclosing the macromolecule. The procedure in DiSCO relies on the linear behavior of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation in the far zone; thus contributions from a number of molecules may be superimposed, and the electrostatic potential, or equivalently the electrostatic field, may be quickly and efficiently approximated by the summation of contributions from the set of charges. The desired accuracy of this approximation is achieved by minimizing the difference between the Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatic field and that produced by the linearized Debye-H\"uckel approximation using our truncated Newton optimization package. DiSCO is applied here to describe the salt-dependent electrostatic environment of the nucleosome core particle in terms of several hundred surface charges. This representation forms the basis for modeling-by dynamic simulations (or Monte Carlo)-the folding of chromatin. DiSCO can be applied more generally to many macromolecular systems whose size and complexity warrant a model resolution between the all-atom and macroscopic levels.},

  abstract = {Salt-mediated electrostatics interactions play an essential role in biomolecular structures and dynamics. Because macromolecular systems modeled at atomic resolution contain thousands of solute atoms, the electrostatic computations constitute an expensive part of the force and energy calculations. Implicit solvent models are one way to simplify the model and associated calculations, but they are generally used in combination with standard atomic models for the solute. To approximate electrostatics interactions in models on the polymer level (e.g., supercoiled DNA) that are simulated over long times (e.g., milliseconds) using Brownian dynamics, Beard and Schlick have developed the DiSCO (Discrete Surface Charge Optimization) algorithm. DiSCO represents a macromolecular complex by a few hundred discrete charges on a surface enclosing the system modeled by the Debye-H\"uckel (screened Coulombic) approximation to the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, and treats the salt solution as continuum solvation. DiSCO can represent the nucleosome core particle ($>$12,000 atoms), for example, by 353 discrete surface charges distributed on the surfaces of a large disk for the nucleosome core particle and a slender cylinder for the histone tail; the charges are optimized with respect to the Poisson-Boltzmann solution for the electric field, yielding a $\sim$5.5\% residual. Because regular surfaces enclosing macromolecules are not sufficiently general and may be suboptimal for certain systems, we develop a general method to construct irregular models tailored to the geometry of macromolecules. We also compare charge optimization based on both the electric field and electrostatic potential refinement. Results indicate that irregular surfaces can lead to a more accurate approximation (lower residuals), and the refinement in terms of the electric field is more robust. We also show that surface smoothing for irregular models is important, that the charge optimization (by the TNPACK minimizer) is efficient and does not depend on the initial assigned values, and that the residual is acceptable when the distance to the model surface is close to, or larger than, the Debye length. We illustrate applications of DiSCO's model-building procedure to chromatin folding and supercoiled DNA bound to Hin and Fis proteins. DiSCO is generally applicable to other interesting macromolecular systems for which mesoscale models are appropriate, to yield a resolution between the all-atom representative and the polymer level. \textcopyright{} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It is proposed that the x-ray reflections at orders of 110 A observed in chromatin originate in the spacing between turns of the solenoid rather than that between nucleosomes along the nucleofilament. The solenoidal structure appears to need histone H1 for its stabilization. Under certain conditions, isolated nucleosomes can also aggregate into a similar structure.

The DNA sequences were specifically labeled by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The relationship between mean-square interphase distance and genomic separation has two linear phases, with a transition at approximately 2 Mbp. This biphasic relationship indicates the existence of two organizational levels at scales $>$ 100 kbp. On one level, chromatin appears to be arranged in large loops several Mbp in size. Within each loop, chromatin is randomly folded. On the second level, specific loop-attachment sites are arranged to form a supple, backbonelike structure, which also shows characteristic random walk behavior. This random walk/giant loop model is the simplest model that fully describes the observed large-scale spatial relationships.

  abstract = {A new Monte Carlo model for the structure of chromatin is presented here. Based on our previous work on superhelical DNA and polynucleosomes, it reintegrates aspects of the ``solenoid'' and the ``zig-zag'' models. The DNA is modeled as a flexible elastic polymer chain, consisting of segments connected by elastic bending, torsional, and stretching springs. The electrostatic interaction between the DNA segments is described by the Debye-H\"uckel approximation. Nucleosome core particles are represented by oblate ellipsoids; their interaction potential has been parameterized by a comparison with data from liquid crystals of nucleosome solutions. DNA and chromatosomes are linked either at the surface of the chromatosome or through a rigid nucleosome stem. Equilibrium ensembles of 100-nucleosome chains at physiological ionic strength were generated by a Metropolis-Monte Carlo algorithm. For a DNA linked at the nucleosome stem and a nucleosome repeat of 200 bp, the simulated fiber diameter of 32nm and the mass density of 6.1 nucleosomes per 11nm fiber length are in excellent agreement with experimental values from the literature. The experimental value of the inclination of DNA and nucleosomes to the fiber axis could also be reproduced. Whereas the linker DNA connects chromatosomes on opposite sides of the fiber, the overall packing of the nucleosomes leads to a helical aspect of the structure. The persistence length of the simulated fibers is 265nm. For more random fibers where the tilt angles between two nucleosomes are chosen according to a Gaussian distribution along the fiber, the persistence length decreases to 30nm with increasing width of the distribution, whereas the other observable parameters such as the mass density remain unchanged. Polynucleosomes with repeat lengths of 212 bp also form fibers with the expected experimental properties. Systems with larger repeat length form fibers, but the mass density is significantly lower than the measured value. The theoretical characteristics of a fiber with a repeat length of 192 bp where DNA and nucleosomes are connected at the core particle are in agreement with the experimental values. Systems without a stem and a repeat length of 217 bp do not form fibers.},

We found that DNA-intercalation of ethidium bromide under these conditions exhibited a complex concentration effect that was dependent on the extent of chromatin folding.

Importantly for understanding the regulation of compaction, this array shows a cooperative linker histone-dependent compaction. The 167-bp NRL array displays a limited linker histone-dependent compaction, resulting in a thinner and topologically different fiber.

Rotational variations within a range of longer NRLs (188 bp and above) typical of repressed chromatin in differentiated cells did not reveal any changes in chromatin folding. In sharp contrast, for the shorter NRL range of 165\textendash{}177 bp, we observed a strong periodic dependence of chromatin folding upon the changes in linker DNA lengths, with the 172 bp repeat found in highly transcribed yeast chromatin imposing an unfolded state of the chromatin fibre that could be reversed by linker histone.

However, there is a long-standing discrepancy between the nucleosome core structure determined by x-ray crystallography and measurements of DNA topology in circular minichromosomes, indicating that there is only \textasciitilde{}1.0 superhelical turn per nucleosome. Although several theoretical assumptions were put forward to explain this paradox by conformational variability of the nucleosome linker, none was tested experimentally. We analyzed topological properties of DNA in circular nucleosome arrays with precisely positioned nucleosomes. Using topological electrophoretic assays and electron microscopy, we demonstrate that the DNA linking number per nucleosome strongly depends on the nucleosome spacing and varies from -1.4 to -0.9. For the predominant \{10n + 5\} class of nucleosome repeats found in native chromatin, our results are consistent with the DNA topology observed earlier. Thus, we reconcile the topological properties of nucleosome arrays with nucleosome core structure and provide a simple explanation for the DNA topology in native chromatin with variable DNA linker length. Topological polymorphism of the chromatin fibers described here may reflect a more general tendency of chromosomal domains containing active or repressed genes to acquire different nucleosome spacing to retain topologically distinct higher-order structures.},

We have collected electron image and x-ray scattering data from nuclei, and isolated chromatin fibers of seven different tissues to distinguish between these models. The fiber diameters are related to the linker lengths by the equation: D(N) = 19.3 + 0.23 N, where D(N) is the external diameter (nm) and N is the linker length (base pairs). The number of nucleosomes per unit length of the fibers is also related to linker length. Detailed studies were done on the highly regular chromatin from erythrocytes of Necturus (mud puppy) and sperm of Thyone (sea cucumber). Necturus chromatin fibers (N = 48 bp) have diameters of 31 nm and have 7.5 +/- 1 nucleosomes per 10 nm along the axis. Thyone chromatin fibers (N = 87 bp) have diameters of 39 nm and have 12 +/- 2 nucleosomes per 10 nm along the axis. Fourier transforms of electron micrographs of Necturus fibers showed left-handed helical symmetry with a pitch of 25.8 +/- 0.8 nm and pitch angle of 32 +/- 3 degrees, consistent with a double helix. Comparable conclusions were drawn from the Thyone data. The data do not support the solenoid, twisted-ribbon, or supranucleosomal particle models.

Four superhelical parameters\textemdash{}inclination of nucleosomes, twist, rise, and diameter\textemdash{}uniquely describe a regular symmetric fiber. The energy of a fiber is defined as the sum of four terms: elastic energy of the linker DNA, steric repulsion, electrostatics, and a phenomenological (H4 tail\textendash{}acidic patch) interaction between two stacked nucleosomes. By optimizing the fiber energy with respect to the superhelical parameters, we found two types of topological transition in fibers (associated with the change in inclination angle): one caused by an abrupt 360$^\circ$ change in the linker DNA twisting (change in the DNA linking number, $\Delta$Lk~= 1), and another caused by overcrossing of the linkers ($\Delta$Lk~=~2). To the best of our knowledge, this topological polymorphism of the two-start fibers was not reported in the computations published earlier. Importantly, the optimal configurations of the fibers with linkers L~= 10n and 10n~+ 5~bp are characterized by different values of the DNA linking number\textemdash{}that is, they are topologically different.

In addition, we make several testable predictions, among them different degrees of DNA supercoiling in fibers with L~= 10n and 10n~+ 5~bp, different flexibility of the two types of fibers, and a correlation between the local NRL and the level of transcription in different parts of the yeast genome.},

Recently, the elucidation of the x-ray crystal structure of a nucleosome tetramer array and the interpretation of electron microscopy images of reconstituted nucleosome arrays suggested two different architectures of the chromatin fiber. We approached the problem by integrating the experimental findings with geometrical, conformational and topological restraints, under the hypothesis of the minimum distortion of the nucleosome and linker DNA structures. We show that the excluded volume at linker crossing and the torsional energy limit the possible close packing of the nucleosomes in the chromatin fiber.

  abstract = {Diffraction of x-rays from living cells, isolated nuclei, and metaphase chromosomes gives rise to several major low angle reflections characteristic of a highly conserved pattern of nucleosome packing within the chromatin fibers. We answer three questions about the x-ray data: Which reflections are characteristic of chromosomes in vivo? How can these reflections be preserved in vitro? What chromosome structures give rise to the reflections? Our consistent observation of diffraction peaks at 11.0, 6.0, 3.8, 2.7 and 2.1 nm from a variety of living cells, isolated nuclei, and metaphase chromosomes establishes these periodicities as characteristic of eukaryotic chromosomes in vivo. In addition, a 30-40- nm peak is observed from all somatic cells that have substantial amounts of condensed chromatin, and a weak 18-nm reflection is observed from nucleated erythrocytes. These observations provide a standard for judging the structural integrity of isolated nuclei, chromosomes, and chromatin, and thus resolve long standing controversy about the ``tru'' nature of chromosome diffraction. All of the reflection seen in vivo can be preserved in vitro provided that the proper ionic conditions are maintained. Our results show clearly that the 30-40-nm maximum is a packing reflection. The packing we observe in vivo is directly correlated to the side-by-side arrangement of 20- 30-nm fibers observed in thin sections of fixed and dehydrated cells and isolated chromosomes. This confirms that such packing is present in living cells and is not merely an artifact of electron microscopy. As expected, the packing reflection is shifted to longer spacings when the fibers are spread apart by reducing the concentration of divalent cations in vitro. Because the 18-, 11.0-, 6.0-, 3.8-, 2.7-, and 2.1-nm reflections are not affected by the decondensation caused by removal of divalent cations, these periodicities must reflect the internal structure of the chromaticn fibers.},

Our interpretation of these results is that the transition to metaphase affects only the packing of chromatin fibers and not, to the resolution of our method, the internal structure of nucleosomes or the pattern of nucleosome packing within chromatin fibers. In particular, phosphorylation of histones H1 and H3 at mitosis does not affect chromatin fiber structure, since the same x-ray results are obtained whether or not histone dephosphorylation is prevented by isolating metaphase chromosomes in the presence of 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) or low concentrations of p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate (ClHgPhSO3).

  abstract = {How a long strand of genomic DNA is compacted into a mitotic chromosome remains one of the basic questions in biology. The nucleosome fibre, in which DNA is wrapped around core histones, has long been assumed to be folded into a 30-nm chromatin fibre and further hierarchical regular structures to form mitotic chromosomes, although the actual existence of these regular structures is controversial. Here, we show that human mitotic HeLa chromosomes are mainly composed of irregularly folded nucleosome fibres rather than 30-nm chromatin fibres. Our comprehensive and quantitative study using cryo-electron microscopy and synchrotron X-ray scattering resolved the long-standing contradictions regarding the existence of 30-nm chromatin structures and detected no regular structure $>$11 nm. Our finding suggests that the mitotic chromosome consists of irregularly arranged nucleosome fibres, with a fractal nature, which permits a more dynamic and flexible genome organization than would be allowed by static regular structures.

The nucleosome fiber (beads-on-a-string), in which DNA is wrapped around core histones, has long been assumed to be folded into a 30-nm chromatin fiber, and a further helically folded larger fiber. However, when frozen hydrated human mitotic cells were observed using cryoelectron microscopy, no higher-order structures that included 30-nm chromatin fibers were found. To investigate the bulk structure of mitotic chromosomes further, we performed small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), which can detect periodic structures in noncrystalline materials in solution. The results were striking: no structural feature larger than 11 nm was detected, even at a chromosome-diameter scale ( 1 $\mu$m). We also found a similar scattering pattern in interphase nuclei of HeLa cells in the range up to 275 nm. Our findings suggest a common structural feature in interphase and mitotic chromatins: compact and irregular folding of nucleosome fibers occurs without a 30-nm chromatin structure.},

  abstract = {Since Flemming described a nuclear substance in the nineteenth century and named it ``chromatin,'' this substance has fascinated biologists. What is the structure of chromatin? DNA is wrapped around core histones, forming a nucleosome fiber (10-nm fiber). This fiber has long been assumed to fold into a 30-nm chromatin fiber and subsequently into helically folded larger fibers or radial loops. However, several recent studies, including our cryo-EM and X-ray scattering analyses, demonstrated that chromatin is composed of irregularly folded 10-nm fibers, without 30-nm chromatin fibers, in interphase chromatin and mitotic chromosomes. This irregular folding implies a chromatin state that is physically less constrained, which could be more dynamic compared with classical regular helical folding structures. Consistent with this, recently, we uncovered by single nucleosome imaging large nucleosome fluctuations in living mammalian cells ($\sim$50 nm/30 ms). Subsequent computational modeling suggested that nucleosome fluctuation increases chromatin accessibility, which is advantageous for many ``target searching'' biological processes such as transcriptional regulation. Therefore, this review provides a novel view on chromatin structure in which chromatin consists of dynamic and disordered 10-nm fibers.},

We report a theoretical model for chromatin (Minimal Chromatin Model) that explains the folding of interphase chromosomes and generates chromosome conformations consistent with experimental data. The energy landscape of the model was derived by using the maximum entropy principle and relies on two experimentally derived inputs: a classification of loci into chromatin types and a catalog of the positions of chromatin loops. First, we trained our energy function using the Hi-C contact map of chromosome 10 from human GM12878 lymphoblastoid cells. Then, we used the model to perform molecular dynamics simulations producing an ensemble of 3D structures for all GM12878 autosomes. Finally, we used these 3D structures to generate contact maps. We found that simulated contact maps closely agree with experimental results for all GM12878 autosomes. The ensemble of structures resulting from these simulations exhibited unknotted chromosomes, phase separation of chromatin types, and a tendency for open chromatin to lie at the periphery of chromosome territories.},

  abstract = {Inside the cell nucleus, genomes fold into organized structures that are characteristic of cell type. Here, we show that this chromatin architecture can be predicted de novo using epigenetic data derived from chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq). We exploit the idea that chromosomes encode a 1D sequence of chromatin structural types. Interactions between these chromatin types determine the 3D structural ensemble of chromosomes through a process similar to phase separation. First, a neural network is used to infer the relation between the epigenetic marks present at a locus, as assayed by ChIP-Seq, and the genomic compartment in which those loci reside, as measured by DNA-DNA proximity ligation (Hi-C). Next, types inferred from this neural network are used as an input to an energy landscape model for chromatin organization [Minimal Chromatin Model (MiChroM)] to generate an ensemble of 3D chromosome conformations at a resolution of 50 kilobases (kb). After training the model, dubbed Maximum Entropy Genomic Annotation from Biomarkers Associated to Structural Ensembles (MEGABASE), on odd-numbered chromosomes, we predict the sequences of chromatin types and the subsequent 3D conformational ensembles for the even chromosomes. We validate these structural ensembles by using ChIP-Seq tracks alone to predict Hi-C maps, as well as distances measured using 3D fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments. Both sets of experiments support the hypothesis of phase separation being the driving process behind compartmentalization. These findings strongly suggest that epigenetic marking patterns encode sufficient information to determine the global architecture of chromosomes and that de novo structure prediction for whole genomes may be increasingly possible.},

  abstract = {For eukaryotic cells, the biological processes involving regulatory DNA elements play an important role in cell cycle. Understanding 3D spatial arrangements of chromosomes and revealing long-range chromatin interactions are critical to decipher these biological processes. In recent years, chromosome conformation capture (3C) related techniques have been developed to measure the interaction frequencies between long-range genome loci, which have provided a great opportunity to decode the 3D organization of the genome. In this paper, we develop a new Bayesian framework to derive the 3D architecture of a chromosome from 3C-based data. By modeling each chromosome as a polymer chain, we define the conformational energy based on our current knowledge on polymer physics and use it as prior information in the Bayesian framework. We also propose an expectation-maximization (EM) based algorithm to estimate the unknown parameters of the Bayesian model and infer an ensemble of chromatin structures based on interaction frequency data. We have validated our Bayesian inference approach through cross-validation and verified the computed chromatin conformations using the geometric constraints derived from fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments. We have further confirmed the inferred chromatin structures using the known genetic interactions derived from other studies in the literature. Our test results have indicated that our Bayesian framework can compute an accurate ensemble of 3D chromatin conformations that best interpret the distance constraints derived from 3C-based data and also agree with other sources of geometric constraints derived from experimental evidence in the previous studies. The source code of our approach can be found in https://github.com/wangsy11/InfMod3DGen.},

By mapping a plethora of genome features onto the constructed 3D chromatin model, we show vividly the close connection between genome properties and the spatial organization of chromatin. We are able to dissect the whole chromatin into two types of chromatin domains which have clearly different Hi-C contact patterns as well as different sizes of chromatin loops. The two chromatin types can be respectively regarded as the basic units of chromatin compartments A and B, and also spatially segregate from each other as the two chromatin compartments. Therefore, the chromatin loops segregate in the space according to their sizes, suggesting the excluded volume or entropic effect in chromatin compartmentalization as well as chromosome positioning. Taken together, these results provide clues to the folding principles of chromosomes, their spatial organization, and the resulted clustering of many genome features in the 3D space.},

Recent characterization of human chromatin using a novel chromosome conformational capture technique brought the fractal globule into the spotlight as a structural model of human chromosome on the scale of up to 10 Mb (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009). Here, we present the concept of the fractal globule, comparing it to other states of a polymer and focusing on its properties relevant for the biophysics of chromatin. We then discuss properties of the fractal globule that make it an attractive model for chromatin organization inside a cell. Next, we connect the fractal globule to recent studies that emphasize topological constraints as a primary factor driving formation of chromosomal territories. We discuss how theoretical predictions, made on the basis of the fractal globule model, can be tested experimentally. Finally, we discuss whether fractal globule architecture can be relevant for chromatin packing in other organisms such as yeast and bacteria.},

Here we investigate the internal organization of the 30-nm chromatin fiber, combining Monte Carlo simulations of nucleosome chain folding with EM-assisted nucleosome interaction capture (EMANIC). We show that at physiological concentrations of monovalent ions, linker histones lead to a tight 2-start zigzag dominated by interactions between alternate nucleosomes (i $\pm$ 2) and sealed by histone N-tails. Divalent ions further compact the fiber by promoting bending in some linker DNAs and hence raising sequential nucleosome interactions (i $\pm$ 1). Remarkably, both straight and bent linker DNA conformations are retained in the fully compact chromatin fiber as inferred from both EMANIC and modeling. This conformational variability is energetically favorable as it helps accommodate DNA crossings within the fiber axis. Our results thus show that the 2-start zigzag topology and the type of linker DNA bending that defines solenoid models may be simultaneously present in a structurally heteromorphic chromatin fiber with uniform 30 nm diameter. Our data also suggest that dynamic linker DNA bending by linker histones and divalent cations in vivo may mediate the transition between tight nucleosome packing within discrete 30-nm fibers and self-associated higher-order chromosomal forms.},

Restoring CTCF reinstates proper architecture on altered chromosomes, indicating a powerful instructive function for CTCF in chromatin folding. CTCF remains essential for TAD organization in non-dividing cells. Surprisingly, active and inactive genome compartments remain properly segregated upon CTCF depletion, revealing that compartmentalization of mammalian chromosomes emerges independently of proper insulation of TADs. Furthermore, our data support that CTCF mediates transcriptional insulator function through enhancer blocking but not as a direct barrier to heterochromatin spreading. Beyond defining the functions of CTCF in chromosome folding, these results provide new fundamental insights into the rules governing mammalian genome organization.},

Analysing $\sim$17 million single-nucleotide variants from the genomes of 652 tumours, we show that regional autosomal mutation rates at megabase resolution are largely stable across cancer types, with differences related to changes in replication timing and gene expression. However, mutations arising after the inactivation of MMR are no longer enriched in late replicating heterochromatin relative to early replicating euchromatin. Thus, differential DNA repair and not differential mutation supply is the primary cause of the large-scale regional mutation rate variation across the human genome.},

  abstract = {A subset of eukaryotic transcription factors possesses the remarkable ability to reprogram one type of cell into another. The transcription factors that reprogram cell fate are invariably those that are crucial for the initial cell programming in embryonic development. To elicit cell programming or reprogramming, transcription factors must be able to engage genes that are developmentally silenced and inappropriate for expression in the original cell. Developmentally silenced genes are typically embedded in ``closed'' chromatin that is covered by nucleosomes and not hypersensitive to nuclease probes such as DNase I. Biochemical and genomic studies have shown that transcription factors with the highest reprogramming activity often have the special ability to engage their target sites on nucleosomal DNA, thus behaving as ``pioneer factors'' to initiate events in closed chromatin. Other reprogramming factors appear dependent on pioneer factors for engaging nucleosomes and closed chromatin. However, certain genomic domains in which nucleosomes are occluded by higher-order chromatin structures, such as in heterochromatin, are resistant to pioneer factor binding. Understanding the means by which pioneer factors can engage closed chromatin and how heterochromatin can prevent such binding promises to advance our ability to reprogram cell fates at will and is the topic of this review.},

The eukaryotic genome is organized within cells as chromatin. For proper information output, higher-order chromatin structures can be regulated dynamically. How such structures form and behave in various cellular processes remains unclear. Here, by combining super-resolution imaging (photoactivated localization microscopy [PALM]) and single-nucleosome tracking, we developed a nuclear imaging system to visualize the higher-order structures along with their dynamics in live mammalian cells. We demonstrated that nucleosomes form compact domains with a peak diameter of $\sim$160~nm and move coherently in live cells. The heterochromatin-rich regions showed more domains and less movement. With cell differentiation, the domains became more apparent, with reduced dynamics. Furthermore, various perturbation experiments indicated that they are organized by a combination of factors, including cohesin and nucleosome-nucleosome interactions. Notably, we observed the domains during mitosis, suggesting that they act as building blocks of chromosomes and may serve as information units throughout the cell cycle.},

This study shows that chromosome images obtained from typical banded karyotypes and from different multicolour cytogenetic analyses can be used to gain information about the internal structure of chromosomes. Chromatin bands and the connection surfaces in sister chromatid exchanges and in cancer translocations are planar and orthogonal to the chromosome axis. Chromosome stretching produces band splitting and even the thinnest bands are orthogonal and well defined, indicating that short stretches of DNA can occupy completely the chromosome cross-section. These observations impose strong physical constraints on models that attempt to explain chromatin folding in chromosomes. The thin-plate model, which consists of many stacked layers of planar chromatin perpendicular to the chromosome axis, is compatible with the observed orientation of bands, with the existence of thin bands, and with band splitting; it is also compatible with the orthogonal orientation and planar geometry of the connection surfaces in chromosome rearrangements. The results obtained provide a consistent interpretation of the chromosome structural properties that are used in clinical cytogenetics for the diagnosis of hereditary diseases and cancers.},

Conversely they are engineered to be nearly meta-stable and disassembled (and reassembled) in a facile manner to allow rapid access to the underlying DNA during processes such as transcription, replication and DNA repair. Nucleosomes protect the genome from DNA damaging agents and provide a lattice onto which a myriad of epigenetic signals are deposited. Moreover, vast strings of nucleosomes provide a framework for assembly of the chromatin fiber and higher-order chromatin structures.

We determined electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) and crystal structures of unbound and H1-bound nucleosomes and validated these structures by site-directed protein cross-linking and hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments. Histone H1 shifts the conformational landscape of the nucleosome by drawing the two linkers together and reducing their flexibility. The H1 C-terminal domain (CTD) localizes primarily to a single linker, while the H1 globular domain contacts the nucleosome dyad and both linkers, associating more closely with the CTD-distal linker. These findings reveal that H1 imparts a strong degree of asymmetry to the nucleosome, which is likely to influence the assembly and architecture of higher-order structures.},

  abstract = {Nucleosomes are important for gene regulation because their arrangement on the genome can control which proteins bind to DNA. Currently, few human nucleosomes are thought to be consistently positioned across cells; however, this has been difficult to assess due to the limited resolution of existing data. We performed paired-end sequencing of micrococcal nuclease-digested chromatin (MNase\textendash{}seq) from seven lymphoblastoid cell lines and mapped over 3.6 billion MNase\textendash{}seq fragments to the human genome to create the highest-resolution map of nucleosome occupancy to date in a human cell type. In contrast to previous results, we find that most nucleosomes have more consistent positioning than expected by chance and a substantial fraction (8.7\%) of nucleosomes have moderate to strong positioning. In aggregate, nucleosome sequences have 10 bp periodic patterns in dinucleotide frequency and DNase I sensitivity; and, across cells, nucleosomes frequently have translational offsets that are multiples of 10 bp. We estimate that almost half of the genome contains regularly spaced arrays of nucleosomes, which are enriched in active chromatin domains. Single nucleotide polymorphisms that reduce DNase I sensitivity can disrupt the phasing of nucleosome arrays, which indicates that they often result from positioning against a barrier formed by other proteins. However, nucleosome arrays can also be created by DNA sequence alone. The most striking example is an array of over 400 nucleosomes on chromosome 12 that is created by tandem repetition of sequences with strong positioning properties. In summary, a large fraction of nucleosomes are consistently positioned\textemdash{}in some regions because they adopt favored sequence positions, and in other regions because they are forced into specific arrangements by chromatin remodeling or DNA binding proteins.},

  abstract = {Nucleosomes are the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin and comprise the structural building blocks of the living eukaryotic genome. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) has long been used to delineate nucleosomal organization. Microarray-based nucleosome mapping experiments in yeast chromatin have revealed regularly-spaced translational phasing of nucleosomes. These data have been used to train computational models of sequence-directed nuclesosome positioning, which have identified ubiquitous strong intrinsic nucleosome positioning signals. Here, we successfully apply this approach to nucleosome positioning experiments from human chromatin. The predictions made by the human-trained and yeast-trained models are strongly correlated, suggesting a shared mechanism for sequence-based determination of nucleosome occupancy. In addition, we observed striking complementarity between classifiers trained on experimental data from weakly versus heavily digested MNase samples. In the former case, the resulting model accurately identifies nucleosome-forming sequences; in the latter, the classifier excels at identifying nucleosome-free regions. Using this model we are able to identify several characteristics of nucleosome-forming and nucleosome-disfavoring sequences. First, by combining results from each classifier applied de novo across the human ENCODE regions, the classifier reveals distinct sequence composition and periodicity features of nucleosome-forming and nucleosome-disfavoring sequences. Short runs of dinucleotide repeat appear as a hallmark of nucleosome-disfavoring sequences, while nucleosome-forming sequences contain short periodic runs of GC base pairs. Second, we show that nucleosome phasing is most frequently predicted flanking nucleosome-free regions. The results suggest that the major mechanism of nucleosome positioning in vivo is boundary-event-driven and affirm the classical statistical positioning theory of nucleosome organization.},

In living cells this organization is determined by multiple factors, including the action of chromatin remodellers2, competition with site-specific DNA-binding proteins3, and the DNA sequence preferences of the nucleosomes themselves4,5,6,7,8. However, it has been difficult to estimate the relative importance of each of these mechanisms in vivo7,9,10,11, because in vivo nucleosome maps reflect the combined action of all influencing factors. Here we determine the importance of nucleosome DNA sequence preferences experimentally by measuring the genome-wide occupancy of nucleosomes assembled on purified yeast genomic DNA. The resulting map, in which nucleosome occupancy is governed only by the intrinsic sequence preferences of nucleosomes, is similar to in vivo nucleosome maps generated in three different growth conditions. In vitro, nucleosome depletion is evident at many transcription factor binding sites and around gene start and end sites, indicating that nucleosome depletion at these sites in vivo is partly encoded in the genome. We confirm these results with a micrococcal nuclease-independent experiment that measures the relative affinity of nucleosomes for $\sim$40,000 double-stranded 150-base-pair oligonucleotides. Using our in vitro data, we devise a computational model of nucleosome sequence preferences that is significantly correlated with in vivo nucleosome occupancy in Caenorhabditis elegans.

Cysteaminyl EDTA was tethered to a recombinant histone octamer via a mutant histone H4 with serine 47 replaced by cysteine. When assembled into nucleosome core particles, the DNA could be cut site specifically by hydroxyl radical-catalyzed chain scission by using the Fenton reaction. Strand cleavage occurs mainly at a single nucleotide close to the dyad axis ofthe core particle, and assignment of this location via the symmetry of the nucleosome allows base-pair resolution mapping of the histone octamer position on the DNA. The positions of the histone octamer and H3H4 tetramer were mapped on a 146-bp Lytechinus variegatus 5S rRNA sequence and a twofold-symmetric derivative. The weakness of translational determinants of nucleosome positioning relative to the overall affinity of the histone proteins for this DNA is clearly demonstrated. The predominant location of both histone octamer and H3H4 tetramer assembled on the 5S rDNA is off center. Shifting the nucleosome core particle position along DNA within a conserved rotational phase could be induced under physiologically relevant conditions. Since nucleosome shifting has important consequences for chromatin structure and gene regulation, an approach to the thermodynamic characterization of this movement is proposed. This mapping method is potentially adaptable for determining nucleosome position in chromatin in vivo.},

The globular domain sits on the dyad of the nucleosome and interacts with both DNA linkers. Our structure integrates results from mutation analyses and previous cross-linking and fluorescence recovery after photobleach experiments, and it helps resolve the long debate on structural mechanisms of nucleosome recognition by linker histones. The on-dyad binding mode of the H5 globular domain is different from the recently reported off-dyad binding mode of Drosophila linker histone H1.

By binding to specific sequences10, CTCF defines contact points for cohesin-mediated long-range chromosomal cis-interactions1,2,4,5,6,7,11. Cohesin is also present at these sites12,13, but has been proposed to be loaded onto DNA elsewhere14,15 and to extrude chromatin loops until it encounters CTCF bound to DNA16,17,18,19. How cohesin is recruited to CTCF sites, according to this or other models, is unknown. Here we show that the distribution of cohesin in the mouse genome depends on transcription, CTCF and the cohesin release factor Wings apart-like (Wapl). In CTCF-depleted fibroblasts, cohesin cannot be properly recruited to CTCF sites but instead accumulates at transcription start sites of active genes, where the cohesin-loading complex is located14,15. In the absence of both CTCF and Wapl, cohesin accumulates in up to 70 kilobase-long regions at 3${'}$-ends of active genes, in particular if these converge on each other. Changing gene expression modulates the position of these `cohesin islands'. These findings indicate that transcription can relocate mammalian cohesin over long distances on DNA, as previously reported for yeast cohesin20,21,22,23, that this translocation contributes to positioning cohesin at CTCF sites, and that active genes can be freed from cohesin either by transcription-mediated translocation or by Wapl-mediated release.},

Cohesin is essential for the hierarchical organization of the eukaryotic genome and plays key roles in many aspects of chromosome biology. The conformation of cohesin bound to DNA remains poorly defined, leaving crucial gaps in our understanding of how cohesin fulfills its biological functions. Here, we use single-molecule microscopy to directly observe the dynamic and functional characteristics of cohesin bound to DNA. We show that cohesin can undergo rapid one-dimensional (1D) diffusion along DNA, but individual nucleosomes, nucleosome arrays, and other protein obstacles significantly restrict its mobility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DNA motor proteins can readily push cohesin along DNA, but they cannot pass through the interior of the cohesin ring. Together, our results reveal that DNA-bound cohesin has a central pore that is substantially smaller than anticipated. These findings have direct implications for understanding how cohesin and other SMC proteins interact with and distribute along chromatin.},

  abstract = {Cohesin is a ring-shaped protein complex that plays a crucial role in sister chromatid cohesion and gene expression. The dynamic association of cohesin with chromatin is essential for these functions. However, the exact nature of cohesin dynamics, particularly cohesin translocation, remains unclear. We evaluated the dynamics of individual cohesin molecules on DNA and found that the cohesin core complex possesses an intrinsic ability to traverse DNA in an adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase)-dependent manner. Translocation ability is suppressed in the presence of Wapl-Pds5 and Sororin; this suppression is alleviated by the acetylation of cohesin and the action of mitotic kinases. In Xenopus laevis egg extracts, cohesin is translocated on unreplicated DNA in an ATPase- and Smc3 acetylation-dependent manner. Cohesin movement changes from bidirectional to unidirectional when cohesin faces DNA replication; otherwise, it is incorporated into replicating DNA without being translocated or is dissociated from replicating DNA. This study provides insight into the nature of individual cohesin dynamics and the mechanisms by which cohesin achieves cohesion in different chromatin contexts.

Single-molecule observations of individual cohesin rings on DNA define how regulatory factors such as acetylation, Wapl-Pds5, and Sororin, as well as DNA replication influence cohesin translocation in vitro and in Xenopus egg extracts.

Scc2-Scc4-dependent topological loading of cohesin is required for cohesin translocation along DNA.Acetylation of cohesin by Esco1 (or Xenopus XEco2) promotes cohesin translocation along DNA and chromatin.Cohesin translocation is suppressed by Wapl-Pds5 and Sororin, and facilitated by Aurora B-mediated phosphorylation.Cohesin is preferentially present and translocated in nucleosome-poor region of unreplicated chromatin.Upon DNA replication, cohesin is either (i) stalled and incorporated into replicating DNA, (ii) translocated with replication, or (iii) dissociated from replicating DNA.},

It has been proposed that cohesin is recruited to specific genomic locations from distal loading sites by an unknown mechanism, which depends on transcription, and it has been speculated that cohesin movements along DNA could create three-dimensional genomic organization by loop extrusion. However, whether cohesin can translocate along DNA is unknown. Here, we used single-molecule imaging to show that cohesin can diffuse rapidly on DNA in a manner consistent with topological entrapment and can pass over some DNA-bound proteins and nucleosomes but is constrained in its movement by transcription and DNA-bound CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). These results indicate that cohesin can be positioned in the genome by moving along DNA, that transcription can provide directionality to these movements, that CTCF functions as a boundary element for moving cohesin, and they are consistent with the hypothesis that cohesin spatially organizes the genome via loop extrusion.},

  abstract = {To ensure proper gene regulation within constrained nuclear space, chromosomes facilitate access to transcribed regions, while compactly packaging all other information. Recent studies revealed that chromosomes are organized into megabase-scale domains that demarcate active and inactive genetic elements, suggesting that compartmentalization is important for genome function. Here, we show that very specific long-range interactions are anchored by cohesin/CTCF sites, but not cohesin-only or CTCF-only sites, to form a hierarchy of chromosomal loops. These loops demarcate topological domains and form intricate internal structures within them. Post-mitotic nuclei deficient for functional cohesin exhibit global architectural changes associated with loss of cohesin/CTCF contacts and relaxation of topological domains. Transcriptional analysis shows that this cohesin-dependent perturbation of domain organization leads to widespread gene deregulation of both cohesin-bound and non-bound genes. Our data thereby support a role for cohesin in the global organization of domain structure and suggest that domains function to stabilize the transcriptional programmes within them.

The boundary sequences between domains are enriched for binding sites of CTCC-binding factor (CTCF) and the cohesin complex, implicating these two factors in the establishment or maintenance of topological domains. To determine the role of cohesin and CTCF in higher-order chromatin architecture in human cells, we depleted the cohesin complex or CTCF and examined the consequences of loss of these factors on higher-order chromatin organization, as well as the transcriptome. We observed a general loss of local chromatin interactions upon disruption of cohesin, but the topological domains remain intact. However, we found that depletion of CTCF not only reduced intradomain interactions but also increased interdomain interactions. Furthermore, distinct groups of genes become misregulated upon depletion of cohesin and CTCF. Taken together, these observations suggest that CTCF and cohesin contribute differentially to chromatin organization and gene regulation.},

This compartmentalization is thought to facilitate the matching of genes and regulatory elements, but its precise function and mechanistic basis remain unknown. Cohesin controls chromosome topology to enable DNA repair and chromosome segregation in cycling cells. In addition, cohesin associates with active enhancers and promoters and with CTCF to form long-range interactions important for gene regulation. Although these findings suggest an important role for cohesin in genome organization, this role has not been assessed on a global scale. Unexpectedly, we find that architectural compartments are maintained in noncycling mouse thymocytes after genetic depletion of cohesin in vivo. Cohesin was, however, required for specific long-range interactions within compartments where cohesin-regulated genes reside. Cohesin depletion diminished interactions between cohesin-bound sites, whereas alternative interactions between chromatin features associated with transcriptional activation and repression became more prominent, with corresponding changes in gene expression. Our findings indicate that cohesin-mediated long-range interactions facilitate discrete gene expression states within preexisting chromosomal compartments.},

Furthermore, we show that regulation of cohesin\textendash{}DNA interactions by Wapl is important for embryonic development, expression of genes such as c-myc (also known as Myc), and cell cycle progression. In mitosis, Wapl-mediated release of cohesin from DNA is essential for proper chromosome segregation and protects cohesin from cleavage by the protease separase, thus enabling mitotic exit in the presence of functional cohesin complexes.},

A large focus is made on the description of the non-equilibrium reactive conformations, with both numerical and analytical tools. We show that the reactive conformations are elongated and are characterized by a spectrum with a slowly decreasing tail, implying that the monomers that neighbor the reactive monomers are significantly shifted at the instant of reaction. We complete the study by deriving explicit formulas for the reaction rates in the Markovian Wilemski-Fixman theory when the reactants are located in arbitrary positions in the chain. We also give a simple scaling argument to understand the existence of two regimes in the reaction time, that come from two possible behaviors of monomer motion which can be either diffusive or subdiffusive.},

  abstract = {Eukaryotic chromosomes replicate in a temporal order known as the replication-timing program1. In mammals, replication timing is cell-type-specific with at least half the genome switching replication timing during development, primarily in units of 400\textendash{}800 kilobases (`replication domains'), whose positions are preserved in different cell types, conserved between species, and appear to confine long-range effects of chromosome rearrangements2,3,4,5,6,7. Early and late replication correlate, respectively, with open and closed three-dimensional chromatin compartments identified by high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), and, to a lesser extent, late replication correlates with lamina-associated domains (LADs)4,5,8,9. Recent Hi-C mapping has unveiled substructure within chromatin compartments called topologically associating domains (TADs) that are largely conserved in their positions between cell types and are similar in size to replication domains8,10. However, TADs can be further sub-stratified into smaller domains, challenging the significance of structures at any particular scale11,12. Moreover, attempts to reconcile TADs and LADs to replication-timing data have not revealed a common, underlying domain structure8,9,13. Here we localize boundaries of replication domains to the early-replicating border of replication-timing transitions and map their positions in 18 human and 13 mouse cell types. We demonstrate that, collectively, replication domain boundaries share a near one-to-one correlation with TAD boundaries, whereas within a cell type, adjacent TADs that replicate at similar times obscure replication domain boundaries, largely accounting for the previously reported lack of alignment. Moreover, cell-type-specific replication timing of TADs partitions the genome into two large-scale sub-nuclear compartments revealing that replication-timing transitions are indistinguishable from late-replicating regions in chromatin composition and lamina association and accounting for the reduced correlation of replication timing to LADs and heterochromatin. Our results reconcile cell-type-specific sub-nuclear compartmentalization and replication timing with developmentally stable structural domains and offer a unified model for large-scale chromosome structure and function.},

Determinants of this and other aspects of genomic nucleosome organization have been ascribed to statistical positioning, intrinsically DNA-encoded positioning, or some aspect of transcription initiation. Here, we provide evidence for a different explanation. Biochemical reconstitution of proper nucleosome positioning, spacing, and occupancy levels was achieved across the 5${'}$ ends of most yeast genes by adenosine triphosphate\textendash{}dependent trans-acting factors. These transcription-independent activities override DNA-intrinsic positioning and maintain uniform spacing at the 5${'}$ ends of genes even at low nucleosome densities. Thus, an active, nonstatistical nucleosome packing mechanism creates chromatin organizing centers at the 5${'}$ ends of genes where important regulatory elements reside.

The long linear chromatin molecule is extensively condensed to fit DNA inside the nucleus. How distant nucleosomes interact to build tertiary chromatin structure remains elusive. In this study, we used cryo-EM to structurally characterize different states of long range nucleosome core particle (NCP) interactions. Our structures show that NCP pairs can adopt multiple conformations, but, commonly, two NCPs are oriented with the histone octamers facing each other. In this conformation, the dyad of both nucleosome core particles is facing the same direction, however, the NCPs are laterally shifted and tilted. The histone octamer surface and histone tails in trans NCP pairs remain accessible to regulatory proteins. The overall conformational flexibility of the NCP pair suggests that chromatin tertiary structure is dynamic and allows access of various chromatin modifying machineries to nucleosomes.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.bpj.2014.09.026},
  abstract = {Chromatin conformation is dynamic and heterogeneous with respect to nucleosome positions, which can be changed by chromatin remodeling complexes in the cell. These molecular machines hydrolyze ATP to translocate or evict nucleosomes, and establish loci with regularly and more irregularly spaced nucleosomes as well as nucleosome-depleted regions. The impact of nucleosome repositioning on the three-dimensional chromatin structure is only poorly understood. Here, we address this issue by using a coarse-grained computer model of arrays of 101 nucleosomes considering several chromatin fiber models with and without linker histones, respectively. We investigated the folding of the chain in dependence of the position of the central nucleosome by changing the length of the adjacent linker DNA in basepair steps. We found in our simulations that these translocations had a strong effect on the shape and properties of chromatin fibers: i), Fiber curvature and flexibility at the center were largely increased and long-range contacts between distant nucleosomes on the chain were promoted. ii), The highest destabilization of the fiber conformation occurred for a nucleosome shifted by two basepairs from regular spacing, whereas effects of linker DNA changes of \textasciitilde{}10 bp in phase with the helical twist of DNA were minimal. iii), A fiber conformation can stabilize a regular spacing of nucleosomes inasmuch as favorable stacking interactions between nucleosomes are facilitated. This can oppose nucleosome translocations and increase the energetic costs for chromatin remodeling. Our computational modeling framework makes it possible to describe the conformational heterogeneity of chromatin in terms of nucleosome positions, and thus advances theoretical models toward a better understanding of how genome compaction and access are regulated within the cell.},

The dependence of the chromatin fiber conformation on the spatial orientation of nucleosomes and the path and length of the linker DNA was systematically explored by Monte Carlo simulations. Two fiber types were analyzed in detail that represent nucleosome chains without and with linker histones, respectively: two-start helices with crossed-linker DNA (CL conformation) and interdigitated one-start helices (ID conformation) with different nucleosome tilt angles. The CL conformation was derived from a tetranucleosome crystal structure that was extended into a fiber. At thermal equilibrium, the fiber shape persisted but relaxed into a structure with a somewhat lower linear mass density of 3.1$\pm$0.1 nucleosomes/11nm fiber. Stable ID fibers required local nucleosome tilt angles between 40$^\circ$ and 60$^\circ$. For these configurations, much higher mass densities of up to 7.9$\pm$0.2 nucleosomes/11nm fiber were obtained. A model is proposed, in which the transition between a CL and ID fiber is mediated by relatively small changes of the local nucleosome geometry. These were found to be in very good agreement with changes induced by linker histone H1 binding as predicted from the high resolution model structures.},

Although similar structures appear to be conserved in fission yeast, computational modeling and analysis of high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data have been used to argue that the small, highly constrained budding yeast chromosomes could not have these structures. In contrast, herein we analyze Hi-C data for budding yeast and identify 200-kb scale TADs, whose boundaries are enriched for transcriptional activity. Furthermore, these boundaries separate regions of similarly timed replication origins connecting the long-known effect of genomic context on replication timing to genome architecture. To investigate the molecular basis of TAD formation, we performed Hi-C experiments on cells depleted for the Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, previously associated with replication timing. Forkhead factors do not regulate TAD formation, but do promote longer-range genomic interactions and control interactions between origins near the centromere. Thus, our work defines spatial organization within the budding yeast nucleus, demonstrates the conserved role of genome architecture in regulating DNA replication, and identifies a molecular mechanism specifically regulating interactions between pericentric origins.},

One striking aspect of nuclear organization is the spatial segregation of heterochromatic and euchromatic domains. The mechanisms of this chromatin segregation are still poorly understood. In this work, we investigated the link between the primary genomic sequence and chromatin domains. We analyzed the spatial intranuclear arrangement of a human artificial chromosome (HAC) in a xenospecific mouse background in comparison to an orthologous region of native mouse chromosome. The two orthologous regions include segments that can be assigned to three major chromatin classes according to their gene abundance and repeat repertoire: (1) gene-rich and SINE-rich euchromatin; (2) gene-poor and LINE/LTR-rich heterochromatin; and (3) gene-depleted and satellite DNA-containing constitutive heterochromatin. We show, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and 4C-seq technologies, that chromatin segments ranging from 0.6 to 3 Mb cluster with segments of the same chromatin class. As a consequence, the chromatin segments acquire corresponding positions in the nucleus irrespective of their chromosomal context, thereby strongly suggesting that this is their autonomous property. Interactions with the nuclear lamina, although largely retained in the HAC, reveal less autonomy. Taken together, our results suggest that building of a functional nucleus is largely a self-organizing process based on mutual recognition of chromosome segments belonging to the major chromatin classes.},

  abstract = {During differentiation, thousands of genes are repositioned toward or away from the nuclear envelope. These movements correlate with changes in transcription and replication timing. Using synthetic (TALE) transcription factors, we found that transcriptional activation of endogenous genes by a viral trans-activator is sufficient to induce gene repositioning toward the nuclear interior in embryonic stem cells. However, gene relocation was also induced by recruitment of an acidic peptide that decondenses chromatin without affecting transcription, indicating that nuclear reorganization is driven by chromatin remodeling rather than transcription. We identified an epigenetic inheritance of chromatin decondensation that maintained central nuclear positioning through mitosis even after the TALE transcription factor was lost. Our results also demonstrate that transcriptional activation, but not chromatin decondensation, is sufficient to change replication timing.
Unpacking for travel to the nuclear interior
The position of a gene within the cell nucleus is correlated with its activity. Those near the nuclear periphery are generally repressed, whereas those in the center are (or will be) active. It is not clear whether this relocalization is a cause or a consequence of gene regulation. Therizols et al. found that transcriptional activation or simply chromatin decondensation both drove the relocation of genes to the interior of the nucleus. The nuclear position was maintained in daughter cells, suggesting that the cell has an epigenetic memory of the gene's position within the nucleus.

  abstract = {During early mammalian female development, one of the two X chromosomes becomes inactivated. Although X-chromosome coating by Xist RNA is essential for the initiation of X inactivation, little is known about how this signal is transformed into transcriptional silencing. Here we show that exclusion of RNA Polymerase II and transcription factors from the Xist RNA-coated X chromosome represents the earliest event following Xist RNA accumulation described so far in differentiating embryonic stem (ES) cells. Paradoxically, exclusion of the transcription machinery occurs before gene silencing is complete. However, examination of the three-dimensional organization of X-linked genes reveals that, when transcribed, they are always located at the periphery of, or outside, the Xist RNA domain, in contact with the transcription machinery. Upon silencing, genes shift to a more internal location, within the Xist RNA compartment devoid of transcription factors. Surprisingly, the appearance of this compartment is not dependent on the A-repeats of the Xist transcript, which are essential for gene silencing. However, the A-repeats are required for the relocation of genes into the Xist RNA silent domain. We propose that Xist RNA has multiple functions: A-repeat-independent creation of a transcriptionally silent nuclear compartment; and A-repeat-dependent induction of gene repression, which is associated with their translocation into this silent domain.},

  abstract = {Summary
We use in~situ Hi-C to probe the 3D architecture of genomes, constructing haploid and diploid maps of nine cell types. The densest, in human lymphoblastoid cells, contains 4.9 billion contacts, achieving 1 kb resolution. We find that genomes are partitioned into contact domains (median length, 185 kb), which are associated with distinct patterns of histone marks and segregate into six subcompartments. We identify $\sim$10,000 loops. These loops frequently link promoters and enhancers, correlate with gene activation, and show conservation across cell types and species. Loop anchors typically occur at domain boundaries and bind CTCF. CTCF sites at loop anchors occur predominantly ($>$90\%) in a convergent orientation, with the asymmetric motifs ``facing'' one another. The inactive X chromosome splits into two massive domains and contains large loops anchored at CTCF-binding repeats.

Analysis of previous chromosome segregation measurements in E. coli demonstrates that the origin of replication exhibits processive motion with a mean displacement that scales as t0.32. In this work, we develop a model for segregation of chromosomal DNA as a Rouse polymer in a viscoelastic medium with a force applied to a single monomer. Our model demonstrates that the observed power-law scaling of the mean displacement and the behavior of the velocity autocorrelation function is captured by accounting for the relaxation of the polymer chain and the viscoelastic environment. We show that the ratio of the mean displacement to the variance of the displacement during segregation events is a critical metric that eliminates the compounding effects of polymer and medium dynamics and provides the segregation force. We calculate the force of oriC segregation in E. coli to be \textasciitilde{}0.49 pN.},

Using CRISPR/Cas genome editing, we generated mice with corresponding rearrangements. Both in mouse limb tissue and patient-derived fibroblasts, disease-relevant structural changes cause ectopic interactions between promoters and non-coding DNA, and a cluster of limb enhancers normally associated with Epha4 is misplaced relative to TAD boundaries and drives ectopic limb expression of another gene in the locus. This rewiring occurred only if the variant disrupted a CTCF-associated boundary domain. Our results demonstrate the functional importance of TADs for orchestrating gene expression via genome architecture and indicate criteria for predicting the pathogenicity of human structural variants, particularly in non-coding regions of the human genome.},

  abstract = {The mammalian HoxD cluster lies between two topologically associating domains (TADs) matching distinct enhancer-rich regulatory landscapes. During limb development, the telomeric TAD controls the early transcription of Hoxd genes in forearm cells, whereas the centromeric TAD subsequently regulates more posterior Hoxd genes in digit cells. Therefore, the TAD boundary prevents the terminal Hoxd13 gene from responding to forearm enhancers, thereby allowing proper limb patterning. To assess the nature and function of this CTCF-rich DNA region in embryos, we compared chromatin interaction profiles between proximal and distal limb bud cells isolated from mutant stocks where various parts of this boundary region were removed. The resulting progressive release in boundary effect triggered inter-TAD contacts, favored by the activity of the newly accessed enhancers. However, the boundary was highly resilient, and only a 400-kb deletion, including the whole-gene cluster, was eventually able to merge the neighboring TADs into a single structure. In this unified TAD, both proximal and distal limb enhancers nevertheless continued to work independently over a targeted transgenic reporter construct. We propose that the whole HoxD cluster is a dynamic TAD border and that the exact boundary position varies depending on both the transcriptional status and the developmental context.},

The dependence on genomic DNA sequence implies that a specific genomic DNA sequence could be a major determinant of target site occupancies achieved by regulatory proteins in vivo, by either governing the time-averaged accessibility for a given nucleosome position, or biasing the time-averaged positioning (of mobile nucleosomes), which in turn is a major determinant of site accessibility.},

By comparing to single-molecule experiments, we demonstrate that a coarse-grained molecular model of the nucleosome can reproduce key aspects of nucleosome unwrapping. Using detailed simulations of DNA and histone proteins, we calculate the tension-dependent free energy surface corresponding to the unwrapping process. The model reproduces quantitatively the forces required to unwrap the nucleosome and reveals the role played by electrostatic interactions during this process. We then demonstrate that histone modifications and DNA sequence can have significant effects on the energies of nucleosome formation. Most notably, we show that histone tails contribute asymmetrically to the stability of the outer and inner turn of nucleosomal DNA and that depending on which histone tails are modified, the tension-dependent response is modulated differently.},

With the resulting free-energy surface, we perform dynamic simulations that permit a direct comparison with experiments. This simple approach demonstrates that the experimentally observed structural states at nonzero tension are a consequence of the tension and that these tension-induced states cease to exist at zero tension. The transitions between states exhibit substantial deformation of the unbound polymer segments. The associated deformation energy increases with tension; thus, the application of tension alters the kinetics due to tension-induced deformation of the transition states.

  abstract = {The nucleosome core particle (NCP) is the basic structural unit for genome packaging in eukaryotic cells and consists of DNA wound around a core of eight histone proteins. DNA access is modulated through dynamic processes of NCP disassembly. Partly disassembled structures, such as the hexasome (containing six histones) and the tetrasome (four histones), are important for transcription regulation in vivo. However, the pathways for their formation have been difficult to characterize. We combine time-resolved (TR) small-angle X-ray scattering and TR-FRET to correlate changes in the DNA conformations with composition of the histone core during salt-induced disassembly of canonical NCPs. We find that H2A\textendash{}H2B histone dimers are released sequentially, with the first dimer being released after the DNA has formed an asymmetrically unwrapped, teardrop-shape DNA structure. This finding suggests that the octasome-to-hexasome transition is guided by the asymmetric unwrapping of the DNA. The link between DNA structure and histone composition suggests a potential mechanism for the action of proteins that alter nucleosome configurations such as histone chaperones and chromatin remodeling complexes.},

Here, we use dual trap optical tweezers to study single yeast RNA polymerase II (Pol II) molecules transcribing along a DNA template with two nucleosomes. The slowdown and the changes in pausing behavior within the nucleosomal region allow us to determine a drift coefficient, $\chi$, which characterizes the ability of the enzyme to recover from a nucleosomal backtrack. Notably, $\chi$ can be used to predict the probability to pass the first nucleosome. Importantly, the presence of a second nucleosome changes $\chi$ in a manner that depends on the spacing between the two nucleosomes, as well as on their rotational arrangement on the helical DNA molecule. Our results indicate that the ability of Pol II to pass the first nucleosome is increased when the next nucleosome is turned away from the first one to face the opposite side of the DNA template. These findings help to rationalize how chromatin arrangement affects Pol II transcription dynamics.},

Using polymer simulations, we show that this model produces TADs and other fine features of Hi-C data. Contrary to typical illustrations, each TAD consists of multiple loops dynamically formed through extrusion, rather than a single static loop. Loop extrusion both explains diverse experimental observations, including the preferential orientation of CTCF motifs, enrichments of architectural proteins at TAD boundaries, and boundary deletion experiments, and makes specific predictions for depletion of CTCF versus cohesin. Finally, loop extrusion has additional, potentially far-ranging, consequences for processes including enhancer-promoter interactions, orientation-specific chromosomal looping, and compaction of mitotic chromosomes.,},

In yeast, significant nucleosome-depleted regions are found, which facilitate transcription. With the arrival of nucleosome positioning maps for the human genome, it was discovered that in our genome, unlike in that of yeast, promoters encode for high nucleosome occupancy. In this work, we look at the genomes of a range of different organisms, to provide a catalog of nucleosome positioning signals in promoters across the tree of life. We utilize a computational model of the nucleosome, based on crystallographic analyses of the structure and elasticity of the nucleosome, to predict the nucleosome positioning signals in promoter regions. To be able to apply our model to large genomic datasets, we introduce an approximative scheme that makes use of the limited range of correlations in nucleosomal sequence preferences to create a computationally efficient approximation of the full biophysical model. Our~predictions show that a clear distinction between unicellular and multicellular life is visible in the intrinsically encoded nucleosome affinity. Furthermore, the strength of the nucleosome positioning signals correlates with the complexity of the organism. We conclude that encoding for high nucleosome occupancy, as in the human genome, is in fact a universal feature of multicellular life.},

Here we investigated the activity of a broad collection of genomically targeted epigenetic regulators that could write epigenetic marks associated with a repressed chromatin state (G9A, SUV39H1, Kr\"uppel-associated box (KRAB), DNMT3A as well as the first targetable versions of Ezh2 and Friend of GATA-1 (FOG1)). dCas9 fusions produced target gene repression over a range of 0- to 10-fold that varied by locus and cell type. dCpf1 fusions were unable to repress gene expression. The most persistent gene repression required the action of several effector domains; however, KRAB-dCas9 did not contribute to persistence in contrast to previous reports. A `direct tethering' strategy attaching the Ezh2 methyltransferase enzyme to dCas9, as well as a `recruitment' strategy attaching the N-terminal 45 residues of FOG1 to dCas9 to recruit the endogenous nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex, were both successful in targeted deposition of H3K27me3. Surprisingly, however, repression was not correlated with deposition of either H3K9me3 or H3K27me3. Our results suggest that so-called repressive histone modifications are not sufficient for gene repression.

Here we show that deletion of the cohesin-loading factor Nipbl in mouse liver leads to a marked reorganization of chromosomal folding. TADs and associated Hi-C peaks vanish globally, even in the absence of transcriptional changes. By contrast, compartmental segregation is preserved and even reinforced. Strikingly, the disappearance of TADs unmasks a finer compartment structure that accurately reflects the underlying epigenetic landscape. These observations demonstrate that the three-dimensional organization of the genome results from the interplay of two independent mechanisms: cohesin-independent segregation of the genome into fine-scale compartments, defined by chromatin state; and cohesin-dependent formation of TADs, possibly by loop extrusion, which helps to guide distant enhancers to their target genes.},

The organization of chromosomes into territories plays an important role in a wide range of cellular processes, including gene expression, transcription, and DNA repair. Current understanding has largely excluded the spatiotemporal dynamic fluctuations of the chromatin polymer. We combine in~vivo chromatin motion analysis with mathematical modeling to elucidate the physical properties that underlie the formation and fluctuations of territories. Chromosome motion varies in predicted ways along the length of the chromosome, dependent on tethering at the centromere. Detachment of a tether upon inactivation of the centromere results in increased spatial mobility. A confined bead-spring chain tethered at both ends provides a mechanism to generate observed variations in local mobility as a function of distance from the tether. These predictions are realized in experimentally determined higher effective spring constants closer to the centromere. The dynamic fluctuations and territorial organization of chromosomes are, in part, dictated by tethering at the centromere.},

Due to the difficulty in reconstituting site-specifically acetylated nucleosomes with crystallization quality, structural analyses of histone acetylation are currently performed using synthesized tail peptides. Through engineering of the genetic code, translation termination, and cell-free protein synthesis, we reconstituted human H4-mono- to tetra-acetylated nucleosome core particles (NCPs), and solved the crystal structures of the H4-K5/K8/K12/K16-tetra-acetylated NCP and unmodified NCP at 2.4 \AA{} and 2.2 \AA{} resolutions, respectively. The structure of the H4-tetra-acetylated NCP resembled that of the unmodified NCP, and the DNA wrapped the histone octamer as precisely as in the unmodified NCP. However, the B-factors were significantly increased for the peripheral DNAs near the N-terminal tail of the intra- or inter-nucleosomal H4. In contrast, the B-factors were negligibly affected by the H4 tetra-acetylation in histone core residues, including those composing the acidic patch, and at H4-R23, which interacts with the acidic patch of the neighboring NCP. The present study revealed that the H4 tetra-acetylation impairs NCP self-association by changing the interactions of the H4 tail with DNA, and is the first demonstration of crystallization quality NCPs reconstituted with genuine PTMs.},

Homologous chromosomes functionally interact with one another to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) introduced either environmentally (e.g., by $\gamma$-irradiation) or deliberately by the cell (e. g., during meiosis). DNA homology recognition in these instances often involves the (RecA) homolog RAD51 and/or the related gene, DMC1. Evidence for interactions between homologous chromosomes occurring independent of DSB formation and (RecA) homolog function has also been described in meiotic, premeiotic, and mitotically dividing cells of yeast. These interactions presumably depend upon DNA homology but the molecular details of such associations are poorly understood. Both DSB-dependent and -independent homolog associations may be facilitated by the nonrandom organization of chromosomes in the nucleus, including centromere and telomere clustering, which are also discussed.},

  abstract = {One of the key goals of macromolecular modeling is to elucidate how macroscale physical properties arise from the microscale behavior of the polymer constituents. For many biological and industrial applications, a direct simulation approach is impractical due to to the wide range of length scales that must be spanned by the model, necessitating physically sound and practically relevant procedures for coarse-graining polymer systems. We present a highly general systematic coarse-graining procedure that maps any detailed polymer model onto effective elastic-chain models at intermediate and large length scales. Our approach defines a continuous flow of coarse-grained models starting from the detailed microscale model, proceeding through an intermediate-scale stretchable, shearable wormlike chain, and finally resolving to a Gaussian chain at the longest lengths. We demonstrate the utility of this procedure by coarse-graining a wormlike chain with periodic rigid kinks, a model relevant for studying DNA\textendash{}protein arrays and genome packing. The methodology described in this work provides a physically sound foundation for coarse-grained simulation of polymer systems, as well as analytical expressions for chain statistics at intermediate and long length scales.},

Chromatin consists of genomic DNA packaged onto nucleosomes\textemdash{}double donut-shaped complexes of histone proteins. Roughly 150 base pairs of DNA are wrapped around each nucleosome with variable lengths of linker DNA in-between. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, Song et al. (p. 376; see the Perspective by Travers) determined the 11 angstrom\textendash{}resolution structure of a 12-nucleosome string of DNA. The segment forms a 30-nanometer fiber structure, which is itself double-helical, like the DNA it packages.
The hierarchical packaging of eukaryotic chromatin plays a central role in transcriptional regulation and other DNA-related biological processes. Here, we report the 11-angstrom\textendash{}resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of 30-nanometer chromatin fibers reconstituted in the presence of linker histone H1 and with different nucleosome repeat lengths. The structures show a histone H1-dependent left-handed twist of the repeating tetranucleosomal structural units, within which the four nucleosomes zigzag back and forth with a straight linker DNA. The asymmetric binding and the location of histone H1 in chromatin play a role in the formation of the 30-nanometer fiber. Our results provide mechanistic insights into how nucleosomes compact into higher-order chromatin fibers.

However, little effort has been made to computationally predict and explain the statistical behavior of semiflexible chains with internal defects. In this paper, we describe the general structure of these macromolecular chains as inextensible elastic chains with one or more internal joints which have limited ranges of rotation and propose a method to compute the probability density functions of the end-to-end pose of these macromolecular chains. Our method takes advantage of the operational properties of the noncommutative Fourier transform for the group of rigid-body motions in three-dimensional space, SE(3). Two representative types of joints, the hinge for planar rotation and the ball joint for spatial rotation, are discussed in detail. The proposed method applies to various stiffness models of semiflexible chainlike macromolecules. Examples are calculated using the Kratky-Porod model with specified stiffness, angular fluctuation, and joint locations. Entropic effects associated with internal angular fluctuations of semiflexible macromolecular chains with internal joints can be computed using this formulation. Our method also provides a potential tool to detect the existence of internal irregularities.},

In order to maintain genome stability and integrity, cells have evolved a wide variety of DNA repair pathways which counteract different types of DNA lesions, also referred to as the DNA damage response (DDR). However, DNA in eukaryotes is highly organized and compacted into chromatin representing major constraints for all cellular pathways, including DNA repair pathways, which require DNA as their substrate. Therefore, the chromatin configuration surrounding the lesion site undergoes dramatic remodeling to facilitate access of DNA repair factors and subsequent removal of the DNA lesion. In this review, we focus on the question of how the cellular DNA repair pathways overcome the chromatin barrier, how the chromatin environment is rearranged to facilitate efficient DNA repair, which proteins mediate this re-organization process and, consequently, how the altered chromatin landscape is involved in the regulation of DNA damage responses.},

The positioning of nucleosomes with respect to DNA plays an important role in regulating transcription. However, nucleosome mapping has been performed for only limited genomic regions in humans. We have generated genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions in both resting and activated human CD4+ T cells by direct sequencing of nucleosome ends using the Solexa high-throughput sequencing technique. We find that nucleosome phasing relative to the transcription start sites is directly correlated to RNA polymerase II (Pol II) binding. Furthermore, the first nucleosome downstream of a start site exhibits differential positioning in active and silent genes. TCR signaling induces extensive nucleosome reorganization in promoters and enhancers to allow transcriptional activation or repression. Our results suggest that H2A.Z-containing and modified nucleosomes are preferentially lost from the -1 nucleosome position. Our data provide a comprehensive view of the nucleosome landscape and its dynamic regulation in the human genome.},

Some studies suggest that linker DNA lengths preferentially occur at certain quantized values, differing one from another by integral multiples of the DNA helical repeat, $\sim$10 bp; however, studies in the literature are inconsistent. Here, we investigate linker DNA length distributions in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, using two novel methods: a Fourier analysis of genomic dinucleotide periodicities adjacent to experimentally mapped nucleosomes and a duration hidden Markov model applied to experimentally defined dinucleosomes. Both methods reveal that linker DNA lengths in yeast are preferentially periodic at the DNA helical repeat ($\sim$10 bp), obeying the forms 10n+5 bp (integer n). This 10 bp periodicity implies an ordered superhelical intrinsic structure for the average chromatin fiber in yeast., Eukaryotic genomic DNA exists as chromatin, with the DNA wrapped locally into a repeating array of protein\textendash{}DNA complexes (``nucleosomes'') separated by short stretches of unwrapped ``linker'' DNA. Nucleosome arrays further compact into $\sim$30-nm-wide higher-order chromatin structures. Despite decades of work, there remains no agreement about the structure of the 30 nm fiber, or even if the structure is ordered or random. The helical symmetry of DNA couples the one-dimensional distribution of nucleosomes along the DNA to an intrinsic three-dimensional structure for the chromatin fiber. Random linker length distributions imply random three-dimensional intrinsic fiber structures, whereas different possible nonrandom length distributions imply different ordered structures. Here we use two independent computational methods, with two independent kinds of experimental data, to experimentally define the probability distribution of linker DNA lengths in yeast. Both methods agree that linker DNA lengths in yeast come in a set of preferentially quantized lengths that differ one from another by $\sim$10 bp, the DNA helical repeat, with a preferred phase offset of 5 bp. The preferential quantization of lengths implies that the intrinsic three-dimensional structure for the average chromatin fiber is ordered, not random. The 5 bp offset implies a particular geometry for this intrinsic structure.},

At present, there is considerable debate as to how the nucleosomes and linker DNA are organized within chromatin fibers, and a number of models have been proposed, many of which are based on helical symmetry and imply specific contacts between nucleosomes. However, when observed in nuclei or after isolation, chromatin fibers show considerable structural irregularity. In the present study, chromatin folding is considered solely in terms of the known properties of the nucleosome-linker unit, taking into account the relative rotation between consecutive nucleosomes that results from the helical twist of DNA. Model building based on this premise, and with a constant length of linker DNA between consecutive nucleosomes, results in a family of fiber- and ribbon-like structures. When the linker length between nucleosomes is allowed to vary, as occurs in nature, fibers showing the types of irregularity observed in nuclei and in isolated chromatin are created. The potential application of the model in determining the three-dimensional organization of chromatin in which nucleosome positions are known is discussed.},

The combined data suggest a novel hierarchical looping model for chromatin higher-order folding, similar to rope flaking used in mountain climbing and rappelling. Not only does such packing help to avoid tangling and self-crossing, it also facilitates rope unraveling. Hierarchical looping is characterized by an increased frequency of higher-order internucleosome contacts for metaphase chromosomes compared with chromatin fibers in vitro and interphase chromatin, with preservation of a dominant two-start zigzag organization associated with the 30-nm fiber. Moreover, the strong dependence of looping on linker histone concentration suggests a hierarchical self-association mechanism of relaxed nucleosome zigzag chains rather than longitudinal compaction as seen in 30-nm fibers. Specifically, concentrations lower than one linker histone per nucleosome promote self-associations and formation of these looped networks of zigzag fibers. The combined experimental and modeling evidence for condensed metaphase chromatin as hierarchical loops and bundles of relaxed zigzag nucleosomal chains rather than randomly coiled threads or straight and stiff helical fibers reconciles aspects of other models for higher-order chromatin structure; it constitutes not only an efficient storage form for the genomic material, consistent with other genome-wide chromosome conformation studies that emphasize looping, but also a convenient organization for local DNA unraveling and genome access.},

  abstract = {Mammalian chromatin is spatially organized at many scales showing two prominent features in interphase: (i) alternating regions (1\textendash{}10 Mb) of active and inactive chromatin that spatially segregate into different compartments, and (ii) domains ($<$1 Mb), that is, regions that preferentially interact internally [topologically associating domains (TADs)] and are central to gene regulation. There is growing evidence that TADs are formed by active extrusion of chromatin loops by cohesin, whereas compartmentalization is established according to local chromatin states. Here, we use polymer simulations to examine how loop extrusion and compartmental segregation work collectively and potentially interfere in shaping global chromosome organization. A model with differential attraction between euchromatin and heterochromatin leads to phase separation and reproduces compartmentalization as observed in Hi-C. Loop extrusion, essential for TAD formation, in turn, interferes with compartmentalization. Our integrated model faithfully reproduces Hi-C data from puzzling experimental observations where altering loop extrusion also led to changes in compartmentalization. Specifically, depletion of chromatin-associated cohesin reduced TADs and revealed finer compartments, while increased processivity of cohesin strengthened large TADs and reduced compartmentalization; and depletion of the TAD boundary protein CTCF weakened TADs while leaving compartments unaffected. We reveal that these experimental perturbations are special cases of a general polymer phenomenon of active mixing by loop extrusion. Our results suggest that chromatin organization on the megabase scale emerges from competition of nonequilibrium active loop extrusion and epigenetically defined compartment structure.},

Here, we combine these maps with new Hi-C, microscopy, and genome-editing experiments to study the physical structure of chromatin fibers, domains, and loops. We find that the observed contact domains are inconsistent with the equilibrium state for an ordinary condensed polymer. Combining Hi-C data and novel mathematical theorems, we show that contact domains are also not consistent with a fractal globule. Instead, we use physical simulations to study two models of genome folding. In one, intermonomer attraction during polymer condensation leads to formation of an anisotropic ``tension globule.'' In the other, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin act together to extrude unknotted loops during interphase. Both models are consistent with the observed contact domains and with the observation that contact domains tend to form inside loops. However, the extrusion model explains a far wider array of observations, such as why loops tend not to overlap and why the CTCF-binding motifs at pairs of loop anchors lie in the convergent orientation. Finally, we perform 13 genome-editing experiments examining the effect of altering CTCF-binding sites on chromatin folding. The convergent rule correctly predicts the affected loops in every case. Moreover, the extrusion model accurately predicts in silico the 3D maps resulting from each experiment using only the location of CTCF-binding sites in the WT. Thus, we show that it is possible to disrupt, restore, and move loops and domains using targeted mutations as small as a single base pair.},

Here we examine by mesoscale modeling how kilobase (kb) range contacts and fiber looping depend on linker lengths ranging from 18 to 45 bp, with values modeled after living systems, including nucleosome free regions (NFRs) and gene encoding segments. We also compare artificial constructs with alternating versus randomly distributed linker lengths in the range of 18-72 bp. We show that nonuniform distributions with NFRs enhance flexibility and encourage kb-range contacts. NFRs between neighboring gene segments diminish short-range contacts between flanking nucleosomes, while enhancing kb-range contacts via hierarchical looping. We also demonstrate that variances in linker lengths enhance such contacts. In particular, moderate sized variations in fiber linker lengths ($\sim$27 bp) encourage long-range contacts in randomly distributed linker length fibers. Our work underscores the importance of linker length patterns, alongside bound proteins, in biological regulation. Contacts formed by kbrange chromatin folding are crucial to gene activity. Because we find that special linker length distributions in living systems promote kb contacts, our work suggests ways to manipulate these patterns for regulation of gene activity.},

By taking into account topological constraints acting on the chromatin fiber, recently-developed polymer models of interphase chromatin can reproduce the observed scaling of distances between genomic loci, chromosomal territories, and probabilities of contacts between loci measured by chromosome conformation capture methods. Polymer models provide a framework for the interpretation of experimental data as ensembles of conformations rather than collections of loops, and will be crucial for untangling functional implications of chromosomal organization.},

Although the moment (torque) response to bending is almost universally linear for small deflection angles, many rod systems exhibit a high-curvature softening. The signature behavior of these rod systems is a kinking transition in which the bending is localized. Recent DNA cyclization experiments by Cloutier and Widom have offered evidence that the linear-elastic bending theory fails to describe the high-curvature mechanics of DNA. Motivated by this recent experimental work, we develop a simple and exact theory of the statistical mechanics of linear-elastic polymer chains that can undergo a kinking transition. We characterize the kinking behavior with a single parameter and show that the resulting theory reproduces both the low-curvature linear-elastic behavior which is already well described by the wormlike chain model, as well as the high-curvature softening observed in recent cyclization experiments.},

Therefore, the energetics of strong dsDNA bending constitutes an essential part of cellular thermodynamics. Although the thermomechanical behavior of long dsDNA is well described by the worm-like chain (WLC) model, the length limit of such elastic behavior remains controversial. To investigate the energetics of strong dsDNA bending, we measured the opening rate of small dsDNA loops with contour lengths of 40-200 bp using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). From the measured relationship of loop stability to loop size, we observed a transition between two separate bending regimes at a critical loop size below 100 bp. Above this loop size, the loop lifetime decreased with decreasing loop size in a manner consistent with an elastic bending stress. Below the critical loop size, however, the loop lifetime became less sensitive to loop size, indicative of softening of the double helix. The critical loop size was measured to be \textasciitilde{}60 bp with sodium only and \textasciitilde{}100 bp with 5 mM magnesium, which suggests that magnesium facilitates the softening transition. We show that our results are in quantitative agreement with the kinkable worm-like chain model. Furthermore, the model parameters constrained by our data can reproduce previously measured J factors between 50 and 200 bp. Our work provides powerful means to study dsDNA bending in the strong bending regime.},

  title = {Prediction and {{Analysis}} of {{Nucleosome Positioning}} in {{Genomic Sequences}}},
  abstract = {A nucleosome is the resultant structure formed when 1.6 left-handed turns of DNA (\textasciitilde{}146 bp)
are wound around a basic complex of histone proteins (the histone octamer). Nucleosomes
occur naturally and ubiquitously in all eukaryotic genomes; the histone proteins themselves
are highly conserved in eukaryotes. Experimental evidence suggests that specific DNA
sequences may exhibit high or low nucleosome-forming tendencies compared to random
DNA. This could mean that nucleosomes, whose positions are influenced by the underlying
DNA sequence, can in turn govern the accessibility of regulatory DNA sequences such as
transcription initiation and replication origin sites. This forms the need to search for evidence
of nucleosome positioning and consequently build models to predict and investigate such
locations.
One theory suggests that DNA sequences, which are intrinsically ``curved'', can
position nucleosomes. In a previous study, using ``cyclical'' hidden-markov models, it had
been suggested that a 10 periodic occurrence of the [VWG] motif could have such an effect
and could help nucleosomes to be positioned in human exons. This work was extended in
this thesis. 60\% of human genomic sequences were seen to be covered in apparently weak 9-
10 bp periodic patches of [CWG]. [CWG]-dense regions were seen to alternate with regions
which were rich in [W] motifs in human. However, the pattern was not the same in mouse.
Another theory suggests that highly flexible or highly rigid DNA sequences may
favour or disfavour nucleosome formation respectively. The locations of such patterns were
investigated in human sequences using the wavelet technique. This approach identified
confined periodic patterns (in the range of 80-200 bp) of rigidity in human genomic
sequences; the patterns themselves were, however, mainly consequences of alu repeatclustering.
However, the same analysis in the mouse genome indicated that such a
mechanism for positioning nucleosomes was not conserved and therefore unlikely.
A different approach to model nucleosomes was to train weighted DNA matrices
from experimentally-mapped nucleosome datasets. This technique gave some encouraging
results (one model showing 100\% accuracy at 40\% coverage), but was restricted by the
limited size of the datasets.
 Overall the conclusion is that there is some evidence for sequence specific
nucleosome positioning, but that more experimental data is needed to build and evaluate
practical and predictive computational models.},

We conclude that even the highest-affinity sequence regions of eukaryotic genomes are not evolved for the highest affinity or nucleosome positioning power. Fourier transform calculations on the selected natural sequences reveal a special significance for nucleosome positioning of a motif consisting of $\sim$10 bp periodic placement of TA dinucleotide steps. Contributions to histone binding and nucleosome formation from periodic TA steps are more significant than those from other periodic steps such as AA (=TT), CC (=GG) and more important than those from the other YR steps (CA (=TG) and CG), which are reported to have greater conformational flexibility in protein-DNA complexes even than TA. We report the development of improved procedures for measuring the free energies of even stronger positioning sequences that may be isolated in the future, and show that when the favorable free energy of histone-DNA interactions becomes sufficiently large, measurements based on the widely used exchange method become unreliable.},
